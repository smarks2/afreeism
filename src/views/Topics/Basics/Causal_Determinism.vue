Skepticism over the existence of free will is linked to a view of the world known as determinism.  As we look at the physical world, particularly the nonhuman world, we generally see two types of events:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"> 
1.  Events that are caused (“caused events”)
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"> 
2.  Events that are random (“random events”)
</p>
<p>
Consider caused events.  A cue ball strikes another ball on a pool table at a certain angle and with a certain rotation.  The movement of the second ball––and whether it ultimately drops into a pocket––depends on factors that were present before the second ball was struck by the first.  These factors include the location, velocity and direction of the cue ball, the amount of spin it has, its mass, the friction of the felt on the table, gravity, the mass and location of the second ball, the location of the pockets, and a host of other factors.  If we knew all of these things, we could predict the path of the second ball and whether it would ultimately fall into the pocket.
</p>
<p>
Because events are caused, we can sometimes predict them, especially if the systems are simple enough.  Often, however, systems are too complex to make accurate predictions.  Still, we believe that such events are caused.  Most people, even believers in free will, subscribe to the theory that most events are caused and, if we understand the causal chain, then we can predict them.  Causation forms the basis of science and engineering.  It has allowed us to construct cities, to build computers and cellphones, and to cure diseases.
</p>
<p>
Determinists hypothesize that all things have causes.  The difference between a determinist and everyone else is that a determinist believes that everything has a cause, whereas everyone else believes only that most things are caused.  Determinists believe that even supposed random events are caused.  (That is, they are not really random.)  When we flip a coin, whether the coin lands heads up or tails up is completely determined by the force and angle of the flip, the physical characteristics of the coin itself (how hard or flexible it is, how much it weighs, what its exact shape is), the amount of air resistance and air currents, the physical properties of the surface on which it lands (its hardness, elasticity, etc.) and many other factors.  Given the complexity of the action of flipping a coin, it is now impossible to predict whether the coin will land heads up or tails up.  Thus, at least to us, the coin flip appears random.  Determinists hypothesize that such events, even though they appear random, are caused; the laws of physics apply to all things.  Indeed, even random number generators in computers are not really random.

(For those of you who are saying, “Hey, what about quantum mechanics?”, we will get to that below.)
</p>
<p>
Determinists hypothesize that the best model of the universe is one that acknowledges that all things are caused (with the possible exception of quantum events.)  Indeed, there is no evidence of an event ever happening that is uncaused or, at the quantum level, random.  Determinists do not make exceptions for living organisms, no matter how complex.  Actions by such organisms are determined by causal factors.  Every action by an organism has been determined by causes that occur through complex interactions at the physical, chemical, and cellular levels, such as the way neurons interact with each other and with other cells.  Like the coin flip, these complex interactions are hard to predict.
</p>

For example, when a dog’s owner calls the dog, the dog must decide whether to come or not.  At one level, the decision to come depends on the dog’s training, the environment (is there a squirrel in sight?), and a host of other factors.  On another level, whether the dog comes depends on the sound of the owner’s voice triggering nerve cells in the ear through an auditory mechanism, which gets transmitted through other nerve cells to the brain, where yet more nerve cells interact in a very complex manner, ultimately sending electric impulses through other nerve cells to muscle cells, which result in the dog either coming to the owner or failing to.  The interactions are incredibly complex, and the result may not be easy to predict (especially if a squirrel is involved), yet the outcome is completely caused.  What the dog does is completely determined.  Given the set of inputs, it could not do otherwise.

The notion of causation is completely intuitive to many people and seems commonsense when applied to inanimate objects, such as billiard balls, and even to animals, such as dogs.  Some people, however, find it hard to accept that such reasoning applies to humans and particularly to themselves.  But there is no reason to suppose that it does not.  As Sam Harris points out,
</p>
<p>
The brain is a physical system, entirely beholden to the laws of nature—and there is every reason to believe that changes in its functional state and material structure entirely dictate our thoughts and actions. 
</p>
<p>
Consider a human action, such as kicking a football or expressing an opinion.  As neuroscientist (and determinist) Robert Sapolsky put it in an interview with National Public Radio Producer David Kestembaum,  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"> 
A muscle did something. Meaning a neuron in your motor cortex commanded your muscle to do that. That neuron fired only because it got inputs from umpteen other neurons milliseconds before.  And those neurons only fired because they got inputs milliseconds before and back and back and back. Show me one neuron anywhere in this pathway that, from out of nowhere, decided to say something that activated in ways that are not explained by the laws of the physical universe, and ions, and channels, and all that sort of stuff. Show me one neuron that has some cellular semblance of free will. And there is no such neuron.

The implication of determinism is that everything unfolds one way.  If determinism is true, everything has been determined since the dawn of time (currently hypothesized to be at the instant of the big bang), including all of our thoughts and actions, when and how we live, who we marry, what kids we have, where we live, how we conduct our lives, when we die, and even whether we will choose to have a cup of coffee this morning.  When someone takes an action, it could not be otherwise.  In other words, if we could unwind the universe back until the time of the big bang and let it run again with the same initial conditions, the universe would unfold in exactly the same way.
</p>
<p>
There are huge implications to this.  For purposes of our discussion, the most important implication is that we have no free will, at least as free will is conventionally defined.  To be sure, we often do what we want because we want it, but what we want has been determined by a chain of causation. Therefore, the choice we make is likewise determined.  In reality, we could do only one thing.
