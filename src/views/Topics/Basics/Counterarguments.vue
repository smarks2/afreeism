<p>
The first three chapters lay out the basic arguments as to why a faith in free will is unjustified and why moral responsibility simply does not make sense.  These are easy arguments to make, but hard arguments to accept.  The notion of determinism (whether causal or stochastic) has produced a furious philosophical backlash.  This is understandable.  We like to believe that we are we have control of ourselves. We like to believe that we are all morally responsible for our actions.  Determinism, and consequently the lack of free will, threatens both of these notions. In spite of the logic of determinism, philosophers have proposed many arguments as to why free will and moral responsibility exist. We owe it to ourselves to consider these arguments.  They are, for the most part, thoughtful and imaginative.  Ultimately, however, they are not persuasive.  Furthermore, by studying these defenses of free will, we come closer to understanding why free will simply does not exist.
</p>
<h2>
Defenses of Free Will and Moral Responsibility
</h2>
<p>
Philosophers have employed a number of approaches to defend free will and moral responsibility.  We can group these strategies into three categories:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	The Libertarian Argument:  The universe is not causally or stochastically deterministic and therefore humans are capable of making decisions that are not caused or random.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	The Compatibilist Argument:  The universe may be deterministic, but we can redefine free will so that free will and moral responsibility exist anyway.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
3.	The Consequentialist Argument:  Free will and moral responsibility (or a belief in free will and moral responsibility) must exist (irrespective of determinism) because the world will be better if they do.
</p>
<p>
These are sincerely held and imaginatively argued positions.  However, none of them holds up to scrutiny.  Nevertheless it is important to understand them, and to understand why they do not work.  Let us look at each of these approaches in turn.
</p>
<h2>
The Libertarian Argument: 
The Universe Is Not Causally or Stochastically Deterministic
</h2>
<p>
Some believers in free will accept the idea that determinism and free will cannot coexist.  If determinism is true, if people cannot do otherwise than what they do, then there free will cannot exist.  Given this, these philosophers defend the notion of free will by arguing that the world is not deterministic.  That is, they argue that humans have the ability to take actions that are neither caused nor random.  Where this ability comes from depends on whom you ask.  Some see this coming from the divine.  Others see it as result of some combination of quantum mechanics and parallel processing in the brain.  (How this might happen is unclear.)  Those who hold these views are known as libertarians.  (This is not the same as the political definition of libertarianism.)  A libertarian is someone who denies that the world is deterministic.
</p>
<p>
Libertarians are a type of incompatibilist.  Incompatibilists believe that determinism and free will cannot both be true.  In order to defend the idea of free will, libertarians conclude that determinism cannot be true.  Other incompatibilists, discussed below, come to the opposite conclusion.  That is, they conclude that determinism is true and free will therefore cannot exist.
</p>
<p>
To understand the libertarian view, and why it just does not work, we have to say something about models.  We can view phenomena from many different levels and through many different lenses or explanatory models.  When we seek to explain a person’s actions, we can approach it from multiple viewpoints.  For example, suppose a person walks into a room and sees her romantic partner in a compromising situation.  She reacts.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Physics:  Certain photons were refracted through the lens of the eye, hitting the back of eye, causing certain atoms to absorb energy, exciting other atoms in the nervous system, ultimately exciting atoms in the hand, contracting muscles, and producing a physical reaction. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Neurobiology:  Light hits photosensitive neurons in the back of the eye, creating electrical impulses that get transmitted to the brain which get processed by the amygdala of the brain, transmitting to the cerebral cortex, causing it to react through a complicated neural network, resulting in a physical reaction.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Psychology:  The subject walks into a room, sees her romantic partner interacting romantically with someone else, which causes anger and brings up memories of the subject’s unfaithful father, ultimately producing a physical reaction.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Sociology:  Human culture has developed mechanisms for organized reproduction, which involve the creation of norms around mating, which have been internalized by members of society and which produce physical reactions under circumstances such as these.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Evolutionary Biology:  Males and females evolved in a manner that encouraged the propagation of genes which result in an instinctual response to oppose other reproductive competition.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Philosophy:  The reaction of the subject can be understood and evaluated through a moral lens that posits how subjects should respond in certain situations.
</p>
<p>
We develop such models because they are useful in motivating, explaining, and predicting human behavior.  Some models are better suited for answering particular questions about certain human behaviors than others.  Specifically, the physics and neurobiological models give us the strongest evidence of causation and determinism.  Indeed, no event has ever been shown to occur without either being caused or (for subatomic particles) being (possibly) random.  Against this overwhelming evidence, libertarians present philosophical models involving mostly thought experiments (all of which are contested by other thought experiments) that would require us to reject the overwhelming evidence provided by the physics and the neurobiological models.  These philosophical models are simply not convincing.  This is not to say that philosophical models are not useful, just to say that for this particular question on whether the universe is deterministic, they cannot hold a candle to the physics and neurobiological models.  For other purposes, philosophical models might be quite illuminating.
</p>
<p>
Libertarians have struggled mightily to prove the existence of free will and to refute determinism.  Ultimately, their attempts fail because they cannot compete with the physics and neurobiological models.  Nevertheless, libertarian models are interesting, even if not convincing.  For the interested reader, a more detailed look at these models appears in Meghan Griffith’s  excellent book on free will.  From there the reader can go to the original works of such thinkers as Aristotle, Thomas Reid, Robert Kane, Roderick Chisholm, Timothy O’Conner, Randolph Clark, Carl Ginet, and others.
</p>
<h2>
The Compatibilist Argument:  
The World May Be Deterministic, But We Can Redefine Free Will So That It Still Exists
</h2>
<p>
Philosophers who claim that free will can exist in a deterministic universe, are known as compatibilists. The terminology is a bit tricky here.  A compatibilist does not necessarily concede that the universe is deterministic, but says that if it is deterministic, free will can still exist.  Philosophers who believe that the universe is indeed deterministic, but also believe that free will exists, are known as soft determinists.  (Thus, soft determinists are a subset of compatibilists.)
</p>
<p>
That said, most philosophers who call themselves compatibilists write and act as if they were soft determinists, that is, as if they do believe that the most likely scenario is that the universe is deterministic but that free will exists anyway.  (You may have heard the canard that an agnostic is just an atheist without conviction.  In the same sense, a compatibilist is just a soft determinist without conviction.)
</p>
<p>
The primary argument for compatibilism is that humans are different from other organisms.  Everything is caused, but the way it is caused in humans is different.  Humans do not act the way insects act, for example.  In insects, if you apply a stimulus you get a response.  Some human activity is like this, but other human activity is different.  Humans often deliberate.  Frequently, when humans make a decision, they do so because of reasons.  Reasons are forward-looking.  Compatibilists call this forward-looking, reason-based decision making free will.  
</p>
<p>
The sorts of things that count for reasons also matter.  Humans have moral values.  These values help define who we are and are inputs into the forward-looking reason-based decision calculus.  To compatibilists, all of these characteristics of human decision making imply free will.
</p>
<p>
At bottom, compatibilists accomplish their goal of having free will in a deterministic universe by defining free will in such a way that free will is not negated by determinism.  Recall that our working definition of free will is the freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention.  The compatibilist rejects this definition.  One simple compatibilist way to redefine free will is this:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
A person exercises free will whenever that person acts according to his or her desires.
</p>
<p>
Under this definition, the fact that what a person desires is completely determined is irrelevant to the existence of free will.  Thus, even if an action is completely determined by prior events (because desires are completely determined), it still can be, according to the compatibilist, a product of free will.
</p>
<p>
The definition of free will that most compatibilists employ is more complicated and nuanced than the one I have given above.  Sometimes this is stated in terms of control.  If a person can exercise control, then there is free will, even though how the control is exercised is completely determined.  Put another way, if the primary causes of an action are external to the individual, then there is no free will.  If they are internal, then there is free will.
</p>
<p>
Along the similar lines, some compatibilists try to dissect the mind and categorize types of decisions.  Those that are influenced by our moral understandings are said to be free.  Those that are determined by appetites, addictions, or external factors are not.  This is sometimes called “source compatibilism” because it looks at the causal source within the brain that generates the decision.  There are a variety of other compatibilist arguments that appear under other labels, such as revisionism  and dispositional compatibilism .  (Just for fun, in the appendix to this chapter, I present a well-known and oft-discussed compatibilist argument.)
</p>
<p>
What is true in all versions of compatibilism is that we end up with a changed definition of free will.  The compatibilist arguments are ultimately unconvincing.  For example, it is true that humans do make forward-looking, reason-based, value-laden decisions.  But that does not change the fact that the reasons and the values were all determined long before the person was born.  There was simply no other outcome possible.  If no other outcome is possible, how can this be free will?  
</p>
<p>
Put another way, does free will exist in Robot World?  The robots in Robot World have the ability to make decisions based on inputs and their algorithms.  We can even program them with moral rules.  The moral rules may sometimes conflict with other goals, so we would have to put into the computer algorithm a way to resolve internal conflicts.  Nevertheless, when our robots make decisions, they do so deterministically.  Would we ever say that they had free will?
</p>
<p>
For compatibilists, the belief in free will and moral responsibility runs up against the overwhelming evidence of determinism.  Compatibilists attempt to reconcile these two ideas.  They do so by changing the definition of free will to such a degree that free will is no longer recognizable.  
</p>
<h2>
Semicompatibilism
</h2>
<p>
The primary motivation for compatibilists is not free will itself.  Rather, compatibilists want free will to exist because they want to hold people responsible for past actions.  Some philosophers have recognized the fact that free will is incompatible with determinism.  Nevertheless, they argue that the concept of moral responsibility for past actions makes sense.  What makes semicompatibilists different from compatibilists is that semicompatibilists go directly to the issue of desert and moral responsibility without getting bogged down in the idea of free will.  This, in a way, is an easier approach since free will is a physical phenomenon while moral responsibility is a social construct.  
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, semicompatibilism fails for the same reason that compatibilism fails.  That is, moral responsibility, even as a social construct, requires the ability to do otherwise.  As always, one could try to create a definition of moral responsibility that does require the ability to do otherwise, but it is not clear how this could be done in a way that makes sense.  As with free will, the better approach is just to admit that moral responsibility for past actions simply does not make sense.
</p>
<h2>
The Consequentialist Argument:
Free Will and Moral Responsibility (Or A Belief In Them) Must Exist Because the World Would Be Worse
If They Did Not
</h2>
<p>
The consequentialist argument posits that free will and moral responsibility must exist because of the consequences if they did not.  This argument comes in two forms.  The first is that free will and moral responsibility must exist since the world would be worse off if they did not.  The second is that we should believe in free will and moral responsibility because the world would be worse off if these beliefs did not exist.  
</p>
<p>
This tracks the way some approach the question of the existence of a god.  Some argue that that a god must exist because the world would be worse off if a god did not exist.  Others argue that a belief in a god is desirable (whether or not a god exists) because without that belief the world would be worse off.
</p>
<p>
Of course, whether the world would be better or worse off without a god or without free will has no relevance as to whether they exist.  The world might be better off if malaria-carrying mosquitos did not exist, but they still do, at least for now.
</p>
<p>
The more serious arguments are those that focus on belief.  These arguments posit that the world will be better off if people believe in free will and moral responsibility.  Thus we should believe in these things, even if they are not true or do not make sense.
</p>
<h2>
The Parade of Horribles
</h2>
<p>
Some philosophers have argued that a world without free will and moral responsibility would be so awful that both free will and moral responsibility, or at least a belief in them, must exist.  Such philosophers often like to trot out stories that illustrate how horrible a deterministic world would be.  The philosopher Daniel Dennett has catalogued a number of these stories.  They include those of the Invisible Jailor, the Nefarious Neurosurgeon, the Hideous Hypnotist, the Peremptory Puppeteer, the Cosmic Child Whose Dolls We Are, the Malevolent Mindreader, and the Digger Wasp. 
</p>
<p>
For example, if determinism is true, are we not, in effect, like prisoners in an invisible jail, under the control of an invisible jailor?  We think we have freedom, but we really do not.  The jailor is secretly constraining us.  Alternatively, perhaps we are in the clutches of a nefarious neurosurgeon who has secretly implanted electrodes in our brains and by means of electrical impulses controls our wants and desires.  We act according to those wants and desires, and thus we think we are free.  However, to control our actions all the nefarious neurosurgeon has to do is to stimulate our brains to change our wants and desires.  Or maybe we have been hypnotized and our actions are controlled by a hypnotist.  Again, we believe we are free, but in reality, the hypnotist controls us.  (The Peremptory Puppeteer, the Cosmic Child Whose Dolls We Are and the Malevolent Mindreader are similar stories.)
</p>
<p>
The Digger Wasp story is slightly different.  The digger wasp is an actual insect with known behaviors.  Scientists have learned to manipulate some of these behaviors.  If we put the wasp in a particular situation, it will act in a particular way.  If we do it over and over again, the wasp will perform identically.  The behavior is completely mechanical, predictable, and determined.  We humans could not possibly be like that!
</p>
<p>
Another example of this type of argument appeared recently in Brainwashed, an otherwise excellent book on the limits of neuroscience.  The authors of Brainwashed would like you to believe that a world without moral responsibility would be unpleasant.  They point to a number of psychological studies that show the adverse effects:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	In the absence of retribution “victims feel unavenged and therefore devalued and dishonored.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	Society loses faith in the justice system if crimes go unavenged.
</p>
<p>
They conclude, “a blameless world would be a very chilly place, inhospitable to the warming sentiments of forgiveness, redemption, and gratitude.” 
</p>
<p>
As another example, Strawson (1962) has argued that because moral responsibility is so important to interpersonal reactions, moral responsibility is justified whether or not the universe is deterministic.   
</p>
<p>
Another consequentialist school of thought carries the appropriate title of Illusionism and is associated with Saul Smilansky.   Smilansky is a compatibilist.  Nevertheless, he argues that, even though libertarian free will does not exist, the libertarian view is the easiest to defend.  Presumably, the unwashed masses cannot understand compatibilist defenses so we should deceive ourselves (and them) into believing that libertarian free will exists.  (Perhaps illusionists fail to consider that the reason that the unwashed masses cannot understand compatibilist defenses is that such defenses do not make sense.)
</p>
<p>
A another related justification is that believe that people will never abandon the belief in free will, so we should just stop worrying about whether free will exists.  If it exists in the minds of people, then for all intents and purposes, it exists. 
</p>
<p>
Again, such approaches are reasons why we should believe in free will and accept idea of moral responsibility.  There are a number of problems with this approach.  The first is that it does violence to the truth.  There is no evidence that free will exists and considerable evidence against it.  And moral responsibility, in the absence of free will, simply makes no sense.  To the extent that we value truth, such willful belief in the face of the evidence is very problematic.
</p>
<p>
The second is that the truth will eventually out whether we want it to or not.  It is difficult to sustain a belief in something that one rationally knows to be false.  The evidence eventually piles up.
</p>
<p>
Finally, a world without retribution would not be a chilly place.   It is true that some human reactions could become less common, such as retribution, righteous anger, guilt, regret, and remorse.  In a world without these emotions, we would act much more humanely towards our fellow humans and towards ourselves.   Other human reactions will remain, including happiness, sadness, gratitude, the sense of connection, and love.   I will say a lot more about this in Part III of this book. 
</p>
<p>
To recap, if the absence of the belief in the myth of free will and moral responsibility has negative consequences, then so be it.  Such is the cost of truth.  However, the second point, to which most of this book is devoted, is that accepting the absence of free will and moral responsibility will actually make the world a better place.
</p>
<h2>
Getting Rid of the Excess Baggage
</h2>
<p>
I am advocating that we accept that the universe is causally or stochastically deterministic and therefore accept that there is no free will and no moral responsibility.  Again, I call this afreeism.  (Others have labeled this position hard determinism  or hard incompatibilism, although there are subtle differences implied by these labels.)
</p>
<p>
In the following exercise, I want you to imagine an intellectual and philosophical trip 
from libertarianism, through compatibilism, through semicompatibilism, to afreeism.  
Imagine first that you are a libertarian.  You believe in free will and you do not 
believe that the universe is stochastically or causally determined.  Some things, 
of course, may be determined, but humans have somehow managed to transcend the laws 
of physics and can take actions that are neither caused nor random.
</p>
<p>
In this model, free will implies moral responsibility.  People are responsible for 
actions they take of their own free will and, as a matter of social policy, we are 
justified in punishing them if, for example, they violate social norms.  We base our 
rewards and punishments on the notion that people are morally responsible and deserve 
blame and punishment for actions that violate moral rules.  
We can diagram the path from free will to a system of rewards and punishment as follows:
</p>
<img src="/../Counterarguments_Fig_1.jpg"  style="height:200px;">
<p>


Frankly, this is how most people think.  Because people have free will we feel justified in rewarding and punishing them on what they deserve.
</p>

<p>
However, suppose that by looking at the evidence, you come to the conclusion that the world is deterministic.  Still, you are not willing to give up the ideas of free will and moral responsibility.  You redefine free will as something compatible with the universe being determined.  For example, you define free will as simply being able to do what you want, even if your wants have been completely determined.  You have become a compatibilist. Once you have decided that free will exists, you conclude that so does moral responsibility.   Again, rewards and punishments are based on the notion that people deserve them.  We can diagram the path from free will to our system of rewards and punishment as follows:
</p>

  <img src="/../Counterarguments_Fig_2.jpg"  style="height:200px;">

<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Now suppose that you have become uncomfortable with the compatibilist strategy of redefining free will so that it fits with determinism.   You decide that it does not make sense to say that a person has free will if that person’s actions were determined by a chain of causation beginning before that person was born.  You abandon the idea that people have free will.  However, you do not want to give up on moral responsibility, so you become a semicompatibilist.  The semicompatibilist does not try to defend the notion of free will and rather claims that someone can be morally responsible for an action even if they did not take the action of their own free will.  Once we have moral responsibility we can again base our rewards and punishments on the notion that people are morally responsible and deserve blame and punishment for actions that violate moral rules.  We can diagram this as follows:
</p>
<img src="/../Counterarguments_Fig_3.jpg"  style="height:200px;">
<p>
The semicompatibilist strategy strips away the baggage of needing to prove the existence of free will in a deterministic universe.  With that baggage stripped away, the semicompatibilist can make arguments for moral responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Note that the advantage of stripping away the need to address the notion of free will is not lost on all compatibilists.  Daniel Dennett, whose treatise Elbow Room is perhaps the most forceful exposition of the compatibilist view, writes in the preface of his newest edition:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
In unpublished lectures I have tentatively explored abandoning the term “free will ” altogether — on the grounds that it simply has too many unfortunate and apparently irresistible connotations to survive reform — while persisting with the topic: the conditions underlying the moral responsibility of normal adult human beings.  
</p>
<p>
In other words, Dennett has considered jumping ship, from compatibilism to semicompatibilism.  (He has not done so yet, at least not in his writings.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, suppose you take the final step.  You conclude that it simply is not right to put moral blame on someone when her actions are completely determined by a causal chain that began long before she was born.  You become an afreeist.  Nevertheless, you do realize that for society to function you will need a system of rewards and punishments.  Likely, this system will be based on things like education, rehabilitation, deterrence, and perhaps occasionally incapacitation.    (Of course, these will not be easy issues.  For one, we will need to justify our policies, that is, justify punishing someone who lacks free will and moral responsibility.)  This view can be diagrammed simply as: 
</p>
<img src="/../Counterarguments_Fig_4.jpg"  style="height:200px;">
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Afreeism strips away all of the baggage of free will and moral responsibility.  One can then go directly to the matter of designing a social system that provides rewards and punishments in a way that promotes human thriving. 
</p>
<h2>
Why These Destinctions Matter
</h2>
<p>
One might say that the differences between compatibilists, semicompatibilists, and afreeists are simply a matter of semantics, of definition.  All three are determinists, after all, and their differences stem just from competing definitions of free will and moral responsibility.  Why does it matter whether we impose a penalty on someone because she committed an act of her own free will, because we believe that she has moral responsibility, or because doing so will reform her and deter her or others in future?  Are not these just three ways of saying the same thing?  Are not the philosophical arguments just angels dancing on the head of a pin?
</p>
<p>
The problem is that when we accept the notion of free will and moral responsibility, we tend to forget that the world is deterministic (even if we intellectually know that it is), and we forget that the criminal that we just convicted had to be there, had to have done what she did.  Free will and moral responsibility are, in a sense, a shorthand that allows us to make easy decisions (at least, easier decisions) without looking closely at what is to be gained and what is to be lost in punishing an individual.  Rather than seeing the individual as someone pushed inexorably by causal forces into what we see before us, we see her as morally depraved, as lacking in humanity, as ultimately something other than us.  It is no surprise that empirical studies show that those who are nudged towards a deterministic worldview are less punitive and less vindictive.
</p>
<p>
And the same applies when we look at ourselves and what we have done.  When we buy into free will and moral responsibility, we forget that the world is deterministic, even if we have previously concluded that it is.  We get down on ourselves.  We see ourselves as blameworthy or guilty and our actions as shameful.  We fill ourselves with remorse.  Or, conversely, we become full of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Libertarians, compatiblists, and semicompatibilists all look at the world similarly and all look at it differently than afreeists.  In short, libertarians, compatibilists, and semicompatibilists are all in bed together fighting for the (philosophical) covers.  The afreeist has realized that the covers are not enough for any one of these philosophies, let alone all three.  The afreeist has gotten out of bed and is throwing wood on the fire.  But is it the comfy fire in the fireplace or the fire that is burning the house down?  In a sense, it is both.  The house of free will is in flames.  Yet, as we shall see, the result is more comfortable than you might imagine.  
</p>
<p>
So, I encourage you to ignore the siren calls of compatibilism and semicompatibilism.  Free will does not exist.  Neither does moral responsibility for past actions.  Trying to define them into existence does more harm than good.  
</p>
<h2>
Moving On
</h2>
<p>
By leaving behind the burning house of free will and moral responsibility, we are free to travel lightly and get to the issues that matter to us, and to approach them head on.  These issues include:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1)	What social policies should we adopt?  What system of rewards and punishments makes the most sense in giving the members of society the best chance to survive and thrive?  How should we best distribute the resources of society?
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2)	How should we deal with other people in our personal lives? 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
3)	How should we deal with ourselves?  How can we live productive, satisfying, joyful lives?
</p>
<p>
We explore these issues in Parts II and III of the book.  Before doing so, however, it is useful to note that the roots of afreeism go back thousands of years.  The next chapter takes a brief look at this history.
