        <p>
          Afreeists do not believe in free will because (1) there is no
          evidence indicating that it exists, and (2) there is a mountain of
          evidence indicating that it does not.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Free will depends on the ability to do otherwise.  
          Suppose that someone gets in a car, drives at an
          excessive speed and gets in an accident.  If the speeding
          were caused by an unknown brain tumor (discovered after
          the accident), then we conclude that the speeding was not
          done of the driver's free will.  Why?  The driver in that
          moment could not have done otherwise.  In general, if a 
          person cannot do otherwise, then there is no free will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence overwhelmingly shows that all events are caused or,
          in the subatomic quantum-mechanical realm, random.  Afreeists
          postulate that the laws of the universe apply to all events.
          That is, humans are not exempt.  All events, including actions taken
          by humans, are the result of a chain of causation.  This chain reaches
          back to before any of us were born.  Thus, whatever actions we take,
          we could not have done otherwise.  Thus we do not have free will.  The notion 
          that we have free will is just an illusion.

          These ideas are further explored in the next three sections (Determinism, Causal Determinism,
          and Quantum Mechanics, Chaos, and Stochastic Determinism).  These ideas are also
          explored in even greater detail in the

          Introduction and Chapter 1.
