      <p>
        We define freeism (free’-izm) as the belief in free will. 
        Afreeism (ay'-free-izm), then, is the 
        absence of a belief in free will. This follows the convention of
        using the suffic a- to indicate a nonbelief.  (For example, theist and atheist.)
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in terms of world outlook, afreeism implies more than just
        an academic shrug as to whether free will exists or not.  If free will
        does not exist, what remains?  The answer is that what remains is a causal
        deterministic universe where every action, thought, idea, or event is determined 
        by causal factors put into place long before any of us were born.  (For those who
        are troubled by quantum mechanical randomness, please see the topic "Chaos and Quantum Mechanics"
        for a discussion of that topic.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge that the universe is deterministic can influence how we think, feel, and act.
        An atheist who finds that there is no evidence of a god, lives and acts as if there
        is no god.  Likewise, an afreeist, finding no evidence of free will (and considerable 
        evidence against the existence of free will), lives and acts as if there is no free 
        will, that is, as if the universe is deterministic.

        This site explores the implications of afreeism, of the nonbelief in free will.  The claim
        of afreeism is that by accepting that free will does not exist, we will live better personally
        and socially.  More specifically:  
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20px">
        •	We will support social policies that are both more humane and more effective. This applies particularly in the area of criminal justice, but also to many other areas of government policy. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20px">  
        •	We will act more generously towards other people in our personal lives. Our behavior towards each other will improve. In particular, we will become more tolerant and more accepting of other people, their life situations, and their actions. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20px">  
        •	We will improve our attitude towards ourselves by mitigating feelings of guilt, regret, remorse, and self-blame, all of which are impediments to a joyful life. 
      </p>
      <p>  
        This is not to say that there are no issues.  What becomes of social behavior if feelings
        of guilt, remorse, regret, and shame are mitigated?  How would our criminal law function?
        (An afreeist would argue that it will function better, and more humanely.)  These issues
        and many more are discussed on this website.
      </p>
      <p>  
        In all, accepting the world the way it is, accepting that there is no free will, 
        completely changes how we look at ourselves and at other people. 
        It affects what we believe is good in the world. The change is profound. 
        If taken seriously, this idea changes the world for the better.
