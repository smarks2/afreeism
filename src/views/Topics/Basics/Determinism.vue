Determinism is the idea that all things are either caused or, in the subatomic quantum-mechanical
realsm, random.  In this website, we will use the following definitions of determinism.
</p>
        <p>
          <b>Causal Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are caused.  Thus, the universe has 
          been and will be completely determined from at least the time of the big bang.  (See the topic 
          "Causal Determinism" for a discussion of this concept.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random.  That is, 
          there may exist some events, such as quantum events, that are truly random.  Thus, if we 
          reran the universe from any given point it could unfold in different ways.  Nevertheless, 
          there are only two types of events, those that are caused and those that are random.  (See the topic
          "Quantum Mechanics, Chaos, and Stochastic Determinism" for a discussion of this topic.)
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;"> 
          <b>Strong Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random 
          and the conviction that there exist truly random events, such as hypothesized by 
          quantum mechanics.  This view is also known as indeterminism.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">  
          <b>Weak Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random.  
          There may or may not be truly random events.  (The jury is out.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use the general term <b>determinism</b> to describe both 
          causal determinism and stochastic determinism.  By this definition, if one says 
          that determinism is true, this means that either causal determinism or stochastic 
          determinism in one of its forms is true.  
        </p>

          Determinism relates to afreeism in the following way.   Determinism is the theory 
          that all events
          are either caused or random.  Since the universe is deterministic, 
          all events turn out the way
          they do as the result of a chain of causation, possibly disturbed here and
          there by  
          random quantum-mechanical perterbations.  This applies to human actions and decisions.  
          That is, humans are not exempt from laws of physics.
          Whatever action a person does, it is a result of this chain of causation.
          As a result, humans do not have free will.  Thus both causal and stochastic
          determinism imply a lack of free will.
