      <p>
In a modern economy, people work, almost always collectively, to produce goods and services.  For the most part, these goods and services are consumed by people other than the producers.  In the process, wealth is created.  The economic system affects what goods and services are produced, how they are produced and by whom, and how they are distributed to members of society.  Economic policy is therefore key to the achievement of a good society, a society that we would like to live in.
</p>
<p>
We therefore must make choices about how our economy is organized.  Some of us do so directly.  That is, we may work for the government and be involved in policy decisions.  At a minimum, most of us can vote.  
</p>
<p>
There is no such thing as a completely laissez-faire position when it comes to economic policy.  If one believes in markets, for example, then the institutional underpinnings of a market economy must be put in place.  Such an economy needs the concept of private property and the means to protect property rights.  Thus it needs property rules and the courts and police to protect them.  And even the most ardent marketeers concede that there are some products and services, such as national defense, that the government should provide.  Others believe that the government should have a role in infrastructure creation and maintenance, such as in the area of transportation (roads and bridges), the power grid, and the internet.
</p>
<p>
Other members of society would encourage additional governmental intervention.  They support regulation, such as the highly successful Clean Air Act, the provision of medical insurance under Medicaid and Medicare, and retirement funding under Social Security.  Among those who agree on these things, there are a variety of viewpoints regarding the level of funding and the breadth of benefits.  Others support minimum wage laws, the regulation of medicines, food labeling.
</p>
<p>
My only point, so far, is that we as a society have decisions to make.  How we distribute the benefits of the economic system is one of those decisions. Although afreeism has little to say about specific policies, it does provide a valuable principle as a starting point.  This principle, which I discussed in Chapter 6, is the Equality Principle.  Here it is again:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	 Unless there are reasons for doing otherwise, the costs and benefits of society should be distributed equally.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	Deservedness cannot be a reason for distributing the costs and benefits of society unequally.
</p>
<p>
The equality principle comes from the afreeist conclusion that there is no such thing as deservedness.  Because the world is deterministic, successes and failures are just the product of a causal web. Outcomes could not have been otherwise.  Thus, no one deserves anything.
</p>
<p>
Deservedness cannot be a reason to deviate from equality.  However, there may be reasons other than deservedness not to distribute wealth and income equally.  We should scrutinize and analyze these reasons carefully.   I will argue that even with these reasons, deviations from equality should be modest.  Unfortunately, they are not.
</p>
<h2>
Measuring Societal Benefits Correctly
</h2>
<p>
Having equality of benefits does not mean everyone will end up with identical baskets of goods and services.  People have different values and will choose (deterministically) their desired basket among those available.  For example, some people value leisure more than others, or value leisure more during some times in their lives than in other times.  If we looked at just goods and services, we might observe inequality, but if we factor in that some people are working harder than others then we might see less inequality.  
</p>
<p>
Some people may choose more leisure over more income.  The value of leisure that they are getting compensates for the lower income.  Suppose, for example, that we can put a dollar value on leisure.  Now consider the following distribution: 
<table>
  <tr><td></td><td><b>Value of Goods and Services Consumed</b></td><td><b>Value of Leisure Consumed</b></td><td><b>Total Value</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Abby</b></td><td>200</td><td>800</td><td>1000</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Bob</b></td><td>900</td><td>100</td><td>1000</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Chris</b></td><td>700</td><td>300</td><td>1000</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Danielle</b></td><td>800</td><td>200</td><td>1000</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Evert</b></td><td>600</td><td>400</td><td>1000</td></tr>
</table>	

<p>
Abby is retired and gets a tremendous benefit from not having to get up and go to work every day.  Leisure is worth a lot to her and she consumes a lot of it.  Bob, on the other hand, is working two jobs and gets very little time for leisure.  Perhaps he is early in his career and wishes to get ahead quickly.  The other members of this 5-person society are somewhere in-between.  If we look at just the value of goods and services, we would conclude that the society is very unequal.  However, looking at total value, including leisure, we see that this is a very egalitarian society after all.
</p>
<p>
In addition, people have different ways of distributing the consumption of goods, services, and leisure over their lifetimes.  Some may prefer more consumption now and less later.  Others may have the opposite preference.
</p>
<p>
Complicating matters is that it is not easy to measure value.  Some goods are priced by the market, so at least at the margins we have an estimate of value.  Other goods, such as clean air or a crime-free neighborhood, are more difficult to price.  Even with market goods, extreme maldistribution of buying power means that the market prices of many goods do not represent their value, especially to those who cannot afford them.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to say that the measurement of societal benefits is not easy.  Nevertheless we may be able to draw some rough conclusions.  
</p>
<h2>
Inequality in the United States
</h2>
<p>
In spite of the difficulty in measuring societal benefits, it is not hard to determine that benefits in the United States and in the world are grossly unequal.  Poverty in the United States is a big societal problem.  This problem of poverty is connected to massive inequality in income and wealth.  So much income and wealth is concentrated in the top one percent (and one-tenth of one percent) of the population that there is insufficient wealth or income remaining to alleviate poverty.  The tax system exacerbates poverty.  (As Warren Buffet says, his secretary pays a greater percentage of her income in taxes than he does. )  Wealth and income also have a racial dimension.  African-Americans and Latinos have far lower income and wealth than whites.  Here are some facts:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
•	In 2017, over 12% of the population (about 40 million people) live in poverty. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
•	About one-third of the population (approximately 100 million people) live in poverty or near-poverty. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
•	As of 2019, the three wealthiest individuals in this country (Bezos, Gates, and Buffet) have more wealth than the bottom 50% of the population (over 160 million people). 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
•	The top 400 richest people in this country (.00025 percent of the population) now have more wealth than the bottom 63% of the population (over 200 million people) 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
•	Among families in the United States, the top 1% have almost twice as much wealth than the bottom 90% of families.  Indeed, the top 0.1% of families have approximately the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90% of families. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
•	Medium family wealth, when measured by race, is highly disparate:   White¬—$171,000; Black—$17,150;  Latinx—$20,720.   (These are conservative estimates.  Other estimates show even greater disparities. )
</p>
<p>
Afreeism says that we cannot justify these disparities by deservedness.  So the question is whether there exists any other justification for such disparities.
</p>
<h2>
Equality and Efficiency
</h2>
<p>
One justification for inequality is that a certain amount of inequality increases the size of the pie.    It does so by creating incentives.  This could be beneficial for everyone.  To see this, consider the following two distributions:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td><b>Distribution A</b></td><td><b>Distribution B</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Abby</b></td><td>100</td><td>2000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Bob</b></td><td>100</td><td>1500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chris</b></td><td>100</td><td>1700</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Danielle</b></td><td>100</td><td>1300</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Evert</b></td><td>100</td><td>1900</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that I am assuming that we are measuring benefit using the same units in the two distributions, something akin to buying power.
</p>
<p>
In Distribution A, the benefits of society are distributed equally.  I would guess that the members of this society would prefer Distribution B, in which all are better off, in spite of the distribution not being equal.  In other words, societal welfare is a function of both the size of the pie and how the pie is distributed.  Perhaps the reason why Distribution B results in such a larger pie, is that the system that underlies it provides incentives for productive work.  If so, then these have to be taken into account.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, efficiency is not the sole criterion either.   In some cases, we would be willing to accept a little smaller pie in exchange for it being distributed more equally.  For example, consider these distributions:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td><b>Distribution A</b></td><td><b>Distribution B</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Abby</b></td><td>2000</td><td>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Bob</b></td><td>2100</td><td>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chris</b></td><td>2000</td><td>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Danielle</b></td><td>1900</td><td>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Evert</b></td><td>2000</td><td>10000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  style="border-top:black solid 1px;"><b>Sum of Benefits</b></td>
    <td  style="border-top:black solid 1px;">10000</td>
    <td  style="border-top:black solid 1px;">10400</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Most people would prefer Distribution A to Distribution B, especially if they made the choice behind the “veil of ignorance,” that is, not knowing who they would be in this distribution.
</p>
<p>
This indicates that the size of the pie may be important, but it is not everything.  There is a trade-off between equality and efficiency.  We are willing to give up some equality for greater efficiency and some efficiency for greater equality.  
</p>
<h2>
Incentives
</h2>
<p>
We have already determined that the distribution of resources should not be based on who deserves it.  In the deterministic universe, no one deserves anything.  However, we also determined that we are willing to sacrifice some equality for measures that increase the size of the pie significantly.  Incentives are one way to increase the size of the pie.  That is, we give rewards to those who are willing to educate themselves, to work, and to take reasonable risks.
</p>
<p>
So, the question becomes, how unequal must the distribution of societal benefits be in order to provide reasonable incentives for efficiency?  This is not easy to quantify precisely.  It depends on knowing how much additional output greater incentives will produce, how much societal value this additional output will produce, how much inequality will be sacrificed, and how much we value that loss of equality.  The question is difficult, but let us give it a try.
</p>
<p>
First, note that the current level of inequality in the United States is staggering.  Again, the top 1% have more wealth than the bottom 90% of the population combined.  The 40 richest people in the U.S., have more wealth than the bottom 63% of the population combined.  The top three wealthiest people have more wealth than the bottom 50% of the population.  Here are the top five wealthiest people in the United States as of 2018: 
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td><b>Wealth</b></td><td><b>Primary Source</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Jeff Bezos</b></td><td>$160 billion</td><td>Amazon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Bill Gates</b></td><td>$97 billion</td><td>Microsoft</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Warren Buffet</b></td><td>$88.3 billion</td><td>Berkshire Hathaway</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mark Zuckerberg</b></td><td>$61 billion</td><td>Facebook</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Larry Ellison</b></td><td>$58.4 billion</td><td>Oracle</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Income is also highly unequal.  For example, here are the incomes for 2018 for the top-earning hedge-fund managers in the United States:  
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td><b>Firm</b></td><td><b>Income</b></td><td><b>Net Worth</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>James Simons</b></td><td>Renaissance Technologies</td><td>$1.6 Billion</td><td>$16.5 Billion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ray Dalio</b></td><td>Bridgewater Associates</td><td>$1.26 Billion</td><td>$16.2 Billion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ken Griffen</b></td><td>Citadel</td><td>$870 million</td><td>$ 9.8 billion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>John Overdeck</b></td><td>Two Sigma</td><td>$770 million</td><td>$4.1 billion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Evert</b></td><td>Two Sigma</td><td>$770 million</td><td>$4.1 billion</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
<p>
In the meantime, almost 40 million persons in the United States live in food-insecure households.  Almost 14% of households with children are food insecure.   One child in thirty will experience homelessness at some time during a given calendar year. 
</p>
<p>
The question is, can such inequality of income and wealth be justified by incentives.  A couple of thought experiments should make the answer to this question fairly obvious.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	Suppose that you had told the young Jeff Bezos, before he ever started working on what would become Amazon, that he stood to gain, say, $10 billion in personal wealth if Amazon were successful instead of the more than $100 billion that he is currently worth, would he have made the same efforts?  (Clearly the answer is yes.)  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	Suppose you had told hedge fund manager James Simons in 2018 that his income would be 90% lower, a mere $160 million for the year.  Would he have refused to work?  (No.)  If you had told him before he ever became a hedge fund manager, that his top salary would be $160 million a year or lower, would that have deterred him?  (No.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, you do not have to be an afreeist to be troubled by the extremes of wealth and poverty.  Nor do you have to be an afreeist to come to the conclusion that these extremes cannot be justified by incentives.  What afreeism brings to the table is that these extremes cannot be justified by deservedness either.  None of these people deserve what they got.  Nor do people deserve to live in poverty.
</p>
<p>
In a way, this is another facet of what we discussed in Chapter 8 on criminal law.  The determinism of the universe means that we should not inflict retribution on people.  Likewise, people do not deserve the abject poverty that many live in.  Nor do the wealthy deserve their massive share of the benefits of the earth and society.  However, just as in the criminal law we tolerate some punishment for the sake of deterring bad behavior and protecting society, we may want to tolerate some inequality for the sake of creating incentives.   In the case of criminal law, we should seek to minimize punishment to a level that still provides adequate safety for the population.  Likewise, with broader social policy we should seek to minimize inequality to a level that provides adequate incentives.
</p>
<h2>
Fixing Inequality
</h2>
<p>
Detailed policy recommendations on how to fix the massive inequality in the United States and in the world is beyond the scope of this book.  Clearly, wealth and income need to be redistributed significantly.  It is also clear that, given the huge disparities of wealth and income, this can be done without significant effects on incentives.  How it is done requires a lot of thought.  
</p>
<p>
For a start, we could tax the incomes of Jeff Bezos and hedge fund manager James Simon at significantly higher rates.  The current system in the United States is perverse in this regard. Someone who makes $60,000 a year pays a greater share of their income in taxes than someone who make more than $1 million when all taxes (income, payroll, sales, etc.) are taken into account.  Again, as Warren Buffet has often pointed out, he pays a lower percentage of his income in taxes than does his secretary.   Wealth taxes should also be on the table as should minimum wage laws.  Universal health care (depending on how it is paid for) could also mitigate wealth disparities, as would a more robust social security system.
</p>
<p>
Money raised using progressive income taxes or wealth taxes could be used to reduce poverty through subsidies such as the Earned Income Tax Credit or through the provision of services, such as health services and investments in public education.  
</p>
<p>
These are just some ideas.  Afreeism does not favor one policy over another.  There is much hard work to be done to figure which policies will help transform the economy to one that more fairly distributes costs and benefits.
</p>
<h2>
The Bottom Line
</h2>
<p>
As we look forward to the future through the lens of causation, we can see that what we do makes a difference.  Although afreeism is not a political philosophy, it does teach us to look at the world in a different way.  Once we discard the blinders of deservedness, we see with clarity how unjustified it is for some to have so much wealth while others live in abject poverty.  No one deserves this.  Our actions could help change this.
