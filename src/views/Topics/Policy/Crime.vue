<p>
  Free will has long been considered the very basis of the criminal system.  
  Consider this quote from the 1978 case United States v. Grayson which in turn cites approvingly the 1952 case of Morissette v. United States.  The court stated:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
The Scott rationale rests not only on the realism of the psychological pressures on a defendant in the dock - which we can grant - but also on a deterministic view of human conduct that is inconsistent with the underlying precepts of our criminal justice system. A “universal and persistent” foundation stone in our system of law, and particularly in our approach to punishment, sentencing, and incarceration, is the “belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.” Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250, 72 S.Ct. 240, 243, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). 
</p>
<p>
What happens when we realize that free will and moral responsibility are just myths?  
What happens when this “foundation stone” of our system of law disappears?  
First note that if the system tumbles into the sea, so be it.  Free will is a myth and we need to accept the consequences of knowing that.  However, I do not believe that the legal structure is so precarious.  It will survive.  It will even be better, more efficient, and more humane.
</p>

<p>
In designing a just and moral society, we are faced with many challenges.  Two primary ones are:
</p>
<p>
1.	What should the rules for behavior be?
</p>
<p>
2.	What should be the rewards and punishments for following or deviating from the rules?
</p>
<p>
The second question presents a particularly difficult problem for the afreeist.  Traditionally, from the perspective of freeism, we convict someone of a crime if that person commits the crime of her own free will.  Using an example from a previous chapter, we have no problem punishing someone for speeding down the highway.  Perhaps the driver wanted to get to an appointment or perhaps just liked the feeling of speed.  Such drivers are subject to being pulled over and issued a fine.  However, if the driver is driving fast because there is a carjacker holding a gun to her head, then we do not punish.  Likewise, if it turns out that the driver had some sort of medical condition unknown to the driver (for example, a brain tumor) that caused the behavior, we are likely to excuse the illegal action.  In these cases, the driver was not speeding of her own free will.
</p>
<p>
In the deterministic world that we live in, there is no free will.  In all three cases above (the speeding driver, the speeding driver with a carjacker, and the speeding driver with a tumor), the fact that the driver is speeding at that very moment was determined by a causal chain that began long before that driver was even born.  How can we punish someone for events that were determined to happen?
</p>
<p>
And if we cannot punish, what is to become of society?  How do we peaceful law-abiding citizens protect ourselves?  Of course, punishment is not the only solution to crime.  Crime clearly could be significantly reduced, for example, by reducing poverty and inequality and by improving education and healthcare.  I will discuss these partial solutions in the next chapter.  In this chapter I will focus on the role of punishment.
</p>
<p>
<b>Guilt, Revenge, Retribution</b>
</p>
<p>
In general, rationales for punishment include these:
</p>
<p>
1.	Teaching people moral and legal standards.
</p>
<p>
2.	Exacting retribution from (assigning blame to) those who violate those standards.
</p>
<p>
3.	Deterring people from violating those standards.
</p>
<p>
4.	Incapacitating (removing from general society) people who would likely violate those standards again in the future.
</p>
<p>
Of the above, the rationale that is most deeply ingrained in us, the one with the deepest evolutionary roots, is retribution.
</p>
<p>
<b>Retribution </b>
</p>
<p>
The retributive goal of punishment is, in short, payback.  It is the righting of the moral scales caused by the immoral and illegal actions of the criminal.  We evolved to punish those who violate moral and social norms.  As Judge Morris Hoffman has observed: 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Evolution built us to punish cheaters. Without that punishment instinct, we would never have been able to live in small groups, and would never have realized all the significant benefits that small-group living conferred, including mutual defense, cooperative hunting, property, divisions of labor, and economies of scale. In fact, to a large extent our notions of right and wrong, of empathy and compassion, of fairness and justice, all come from the tensions of group living, and thus indirectly owe their very existence to punishment. 
</p>
<p>
In a footnote to this paragraph, Hoffman goes on to say:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Exactly how punishment might have evolved to enable our social living remains a hot topic among evolutionary theorists. Scholars across many disciplines, from evolutionary biology and psychology to economics and even neuroscience, seem to be converging on the idea that we needed punishment to help bind us into our extraordinarily intense social groups.  
</p>
<p>
Hoffman goes on to point out that our brains are wired to implement punishment in three ways: 
</p>
<p>
1.	We feel guilt at our own antisocial behavior.  (First-party punishment.)
</p>
<p>
2.	We feel the need to retaliate against and to seek revenge from those who harm us.  (Second-party punishment.)
</p>
<p>
3.	We feel the need to exact retribution against those who harm others.  (Third-party punishment.)
</p>
<p>
Or as another has put it, in describing retribution,
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
. . . the essence of punishment is to restrict a criminal's will by depriving him of the right to be the sole author of his own actions. The goal of punishment, in short, is the undoing of the criminal's bold and unjust assertion of his own will. 
</p>
<p>
This type of punishment has deep cerebral roots.  As Robert Sapolsky notes, punishing someone for violating moral norms . . .
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
. . . is a deep, atavistic pleasure.  Put people in brain scanners, give them scenarios of norm violations.  Decision making about culpability for the violation correlates with activity in the cognitive dlPFC.  But decision making about appropriate punishment activates the emotional vmPFC, along with the amygdala and insula; the more activation, the more punishment.  The decision to punish, the passionate motivation to do so, is a frothy limbic state. . . . Punishment just feels that good. 
</p>
<p>
However, punishment only feels good if we believe that the person who receives the punishment deserves it.  Punishing the wrong person, or punishing someone who could not do otherwise, brings no pleasure at all.  We do not get pleasure from seeing someone punished who was caused to commit the act because of an epileptic seizure, a gun held to her head, or in self-defense.  
</p>
<p>
Of course, because the world is deterministic, every act is of this sort.  That is, every act is the result of a chain of causation that began before we were born.  Retribution is never justified because we could not have done otherwise.  Acknowledging that the universe is deterministic should diminish any retributive pleasure from all punishment, and it should further remove any consideration of retribution as a justification for punishment.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Punishing the Innocent</b>
</p>
<p>
Of course, retribution is not the only basis for punishment.  Other rationales include education, deterrence, and incapacitation.  Nevertheless, because the world is deterministic all punishments involve the punishment of innocents.  So if we are to punish, we must be able to justify the punishment of innocents.  Otherwise, we must abandon punishment altogether.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Public Health Perspective</b>
</p>
<p>
If we abandon moral responsibility (as we must), we can no longer use this as a basis for punishment.  What then?  What do we replace it with?  Derk Pereboom suggests that rather than basing the criminal law on moral responsibility, we should instead base the criminal law on a public health model.  Those who commit crimes are not bad people who deserve to be punished.  Rather they are morally sick.  Since they are sick, we should try to cure them by providing treatment that will change their moral values.  If we fail to cure them, we should quarantine them so that they do no additional harm to society.  Using this reasoning, Pereboom suggests that we can justify punishment for the purpose of education.  And, in some cases, we are justified in removing a person from society.
</p>
<p>
From this perspective, crime is treated as a serious communicable disease.   The criminal and the infected patient both harm those around them.  In both cases this can be remedied through treatment (curing the patient or reforming the criminal) or by removal (quarantining the patient or jailing the criminal) or both.  The public health model suggests that we attempt to reform the criminal.  Failing that, we are justified in separating the criminal from general society.
</p>
<p>
The public health model has much to commend it.  Basing punishment on a public health model will likely result in more humane treatment of criminals and could be quite effective at reducing antisocial behavior.  Under this model, those violating the law should be treated as humanely as possible consistent with the goal of reforming the violator’s moral attitudes.  Indeed, currently there are programs that take this approach and they have been quite effective in reducing recidivism.   This approach also implies that, in cases where the individual must be removed from society, we do it humanely.  That is, we do our best to give the criminally dangerous person a decent life.  The public health approach permits the punishment and confinement of innocents as long as punishment and confinement are humane. 
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, there are some differences between contagious illnesses and criminal behavior.  In the case of contagious illness, the sick person typically wants to be cured.  The disease has a great impact on the well-being of the sick person and this typically leads to a desire to accept treatment.  Therefore, a sick person usually consents to her treatment.  If she does not want to be treated, we do not treat her.  In the case of a criminal, the criminal may have no desire to be cured and may not consent to the treatment.  (That is, the criminal may not consent to being confined, to paying a fine, or to participating in programs.)  
</p>
<p>
In the case of a serious communicable disease, we may feel justified in giving the sick person a choice: either accept treatment or be quarantined.  We may even say that the sick person must be quarantined until she is cured, or at least until she ceases to be contagious.  One problem for criminal law is that we do not have good markers as to whether someone is no longer a threat to society.  Even the best programs for rehabilitation have significant recidivism rates.
</p>
<p>
In addition, under the public health model there are only two reasons to lock someone up: incapacitation or re-education.  But suppose that re-education is not possible?  Imagine someone who, no matter what, will drive 10 miles an hour over the speed limit.  No matter how much education we subject this person to, she will speed.  Since she cannot be re-educated, under the public health model our only option is to incapacitate her, that is, to quarantine her.  In other words, we would have either to incarcerate such people or give up on having effective speed limits.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Deterrence</b>
</p>
<p>
Of course, there is another solution.  If we tell the driver that every time she drives over the speed limit there is a 10% chance of a $1000 fine, it may turn out that she stops driving over the speed limit.  
</p>
<p>
Deterrence is not retributive.  It seeks simply to change behavior through the application of punishment.  However, it comes up against our original problem: the punishment of innocents.  
</p>
<p>
Some who object to deterrence as a basis for punishment ask the following question:  would it be acceptable to punish an innocent party, if that would deter others from committing a crime?  For example, one can imagine a scenario in which a government announces that it has found the perpetrators of a crime, even though it has not, for the purpose of convincing the population that if a crime is committed the guilty party will be found and punished.  Punishing innocents in this matter may reduce crime and make everyone on average better off.  That is, the unhappiness of the innocent scapegoat may be offset by the increased happiness of everyone else.  
</p>
<p>
Most people (and I include myself) would find the above scenario objectionable, even immoral.   One might say that to punish the innocent to protect the larger population is wrong.  But if we adopt such a blanket statement, we will have to abandon punishment altogether, since everyone is always innocent.  There must be an alternative to this approach.
</p>
<p>
First, note that even those who believe in free will, accept that the criminal system, if it is to have punishment at all, will inevitably punish innocents.  That is, sometimes the system will err.  Therefore, anyone who argues for punishment of any sort, consents to the punishment of some unknown quantity of innocents.  Therefore, the issue is not really whether we should accept the punishment of innocents, but rather under what circumstances.  For example, it may be morally justified to punish innocents in error but not intentionally.
</p>
<p>
But even this formulation does not help us, because whenever we intentionally apply punishment we are doing so to innocents, since in a deterministic world, everyone is always innocent.  Thus, in order to have punishment we must be able to justify intentionally punishing innocents.  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. recognized that punishment meant punishing those we know are innocent in order to deter others:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
If I were having a philosophical talk with a man I was going to have hanged (or electrocuted) I should say, “I don’t doubt that your act was inevitable for you, but to make it more avoidable by others we propose to sacrifice you to the common good. You may regard yourself as a soldier dying for your country if you like.” 
</p>
<p>
So the issue becomes, are we justified in punishing someone we know to be innocent in order to deter others?  If so, under what circumstances can we do so?
</p>
<p>
<b>Justifying Punishment</b>
</p>
<p>
Here again, the public health model might be instructive.  Most of us agree that we have the right to quarantine someone to protect the public good.  When we quarantine someone, we may be  confining them against their will in order to protect the public, even though we know that such a person is innocent of any wrongdoing.  In other words, we are imposing adverse consequences (confinement) on an innocent person for the benefit of others in society.  This, it seems, is morally acceptable.  Indeed, we would probably consider it to be immoral to do otherwise.
</p>
<p>
It is worth pausing for a moment, to ask why we feel it is morally justifiable to quarantine an individual against her desires.  The answer to this question involves understanding why we ever feel justified in bringing the power of the state to bear on individuals.  This has been the subject of much philosophical inquiry.  There is no single satisfactory answer to this question, but there are some fruitful lines of inquiry.  Before proceeding, however, I want to acknowledge that the following ideas are not without controversy.  That said, let us proceed.
</p>
<p>
Ever since Socrates, philosophers have tried to determine the content of moral and social laws and also have tried to determine when and how the state is justified in enforcing moral and social laws.  One mechanism that philosophers often use is social contract theory.  This theory probably dates from the time of Socrates, but it had its first full development by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679).  According to social contract theory, we all implicitly enter into a contract with each other and with the sovereign to enact laws that prescribe behaviors and laws that specify the consequences if we deviate from those behaviors.  Since it is clear that none of us have ever entered into such a contract, since no such contract exists with our signatures on it, our agreement is implicit.  What does this mean?  In a sense it means that if we were presented with such a contract we would find it in our best interest to sign it.  “Our best interest” is broadly defined.  We may agree to sign the contract because it benefits us, our families, our friends, or even society at large. 
</p>
<p>
To this theoretical construct, the philosopher John Rawls (1921-2002) added his notion of the “veil of ignorance.”  To evaluate a societal rule involving behavior or consequences, we pretend that we are in the “original position” of not knowing who we will be in society.  That is, we are asked to design the rules of society without knowing our gender, sexual orientation or identification, or social class.  We do not know our ethnicity, race, or where we will be living.  We do not know if we will be tall, short, whether we can walk or are confined to a wheelchair, whether we are sighted or blind.  We do not know our intelligence or talents in any particular area.  We know nothing of what our personal characteristics or personal history will be.  From this original position, behind the veil of ignorance, we must choose our societal rules.  Given all this, are there any rules that all of us (or the vast majority of us) would agree on?
</p>
<p>
Let us apply this idea to the problem at hand.  Under such circumstances, would we choose a world in which innocent people with highly contagious and dangerous diseases could be quarantined against their will?  Likely, we would, even knowing that we might be that person.  However, we would insist on humane conditions for the quarantine.  
</p>
<p>
By the same logic, it is likely that most of us would agree to establish a system of punishment that would operate as a deterrent to the commission of certain harmful acts, even though we acknowledge that we will be intentionally punishing innocent actors in every case, given that, in the deterministic universe, everyone is innocent.   We realize in doing so that we may be among those innocent actors who are punished.  That is, we justify the imposition of adverse consequences (confinement, fines, etc.) on an innocent person for the benefit of others in society, recognizing that that person could be us.   This is just as moral as quarantining an innocent person who has contracted a serious and highly contagious illness.
</p>
<p>
<b>Limitations on Deterrence</b>
</p>
<p>
We do, however, want to be careful.  For example, it seems clear that we would never want to endorse punishing those who did not actually commit the crime just to deter others.  There are several reasons for this.  First, if we permitted this practice the deterrent value of punishment would go down, since we would never know whether people are being punished arbitrarily or because they committed the act.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, we simply should not trust any government with this kind of power.  Our fear is that the government would use this power for all sorts of nefarious purposes.  By prohibiting this behavior, we put a check on government power.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, punishment cannot deter some behaviors.  Punishing a speeding driver with a gun to her head will not deter her.  Nor would punishing an action that was caused by a brain tumor.  Nor will punishment deter if the action is in response to a higher need, such as self-defense or to protect something of higher personal value.  In these cases, deterrence cannot be a justification for punishment.  In addition, if the person is a compulsive criminal or a sociopath or is otherwise psychologically undeterable, then deterrence cannot be a justification for punishment.  We may, however, be justified in quarantining that person.  If we do so, however, it should be done humanely.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, there are those who do not believe that deterrence is very effective.  Philosopher and writer Raoul Martinez, for example, forcefully argues against the use of deterrence as a justification for punishment.   Indeed, many of our notions about the effectiveness of deterrence are not supported by data.  Nevertheless, it is clear that deterrence does work in many cases and, if thoughtfully applied, can often be justified.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can Free Will and Moral Responsibility Be Justified by Deterrence?</b>
</p>
<p>
If you accept all of the above, then you might argue that a belief in free will and moral responsibility can reenter the scene through the backdoor of deterrence.  That is, even if free will does not actually exist, could it be that a belief in free will (and thus in moral responsibility) will deter people from violating social norms?  In other words, from the perspective behind the veil of ignorance, might we all agree to ignore the evidence against free will and moral responsibility and convince ourselves to believe it?  This will serve to deter us.  This idea is similar to an argument for the belief in a god.  We could all agree to believe in a god.  The belief in a god (whether true or not) will foster conformance to the moral norms.   
</p>
<p>
Of course, just stating the above proposition reveals its weaknesses.  First, one cannot simply choose to believe something that one knows to be false.  Free will and moral responsibility are part of a mythology.  This mythology has been under attack for thousands of years, but the last few decades of progress in artificial intelligence and neuroscience has brought new ammunition to bear.  The mythology only works if there are believers.  As more people accept the deterministic nature of the universe and the nonexistence of free will, the less effective this approach will become.  
</p>
<p>
Second, this mythology is a blunt tool.  Although it may deter some bad behavior it can also be the cause of bad behavior.  I saw an example of this fairly recently.  My wife was on a jury which had to determine whether a convicted sexual predator should be released.  Call him John.  John had coerced underaged girls to have sex years ago.  He had been convicted and had served his time, over 30 years.  However, under state law, the state could hold John indefinitely if John were found to be a threat to society.  John suffered from cerebral palsy which had progressed during the span of his imprisonment.  He was confined to a wheelchair, not able to stand up.  His limbs shook and he had to be fed.  The jury found 11-1 that John should continue to be held and thus his release was denied.  (Since this was not a criminal proceeding at this point, John needed a majority decision in his favor to be released.)  The attitude of the majority of the jury was expressed by the foreman who said, “If he did that to my daughter, I would lock him up and throw away the key,” which is effectively what this jury did.
</p>
<p>
In the above case, the jury’s decision was made on the basis of retribution, clearly ignoring the law in its decision not to release, since John had served his time and posed no threat to society.  It is hard to understand how such an outcome benefits society.  If the jury had truly understood the deterministic nature of John’s actions, they would see that he too is a victim.  This is not to say that John should not have been punished.  Punishment serves a teaching and a deterrent function.  However, keeping John locked up at this point is wrong.
</p>
<p>
Creating mythologies can serve useful purposes, but they can also run amok. Speaking of the mythology of religion, physics Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg wrote:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Frederick Douglass told in his Narrative how his condition as a slave became worse when his master underwent a religious conversion that allowed him to justify slavery as the punishment of the children of Ham. Mark Twain described his mother as a genuinely good person, whose soft heart pitied even Satan, but who had no doubt about the legitimacy of slavery, because in years of living in antebellum Missouri she had never heard any sermon opposing slavery, but only countless sermons preaching that slavery was God's will. With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil--that takes religion. (My italics.) 
</p>
<p>
We see this everyday when people who believe they are doing good, end up doing harm.  Examples of this include young women and men willing to blow themselves and others up, violent attacks on gay and transgender people, and deadly bombings of Planned Parenthood clinics.  The religion of free will and moral responsibility can create equally bad outcomes, since it is used to justify inhumane retributive policies.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Crime and Punishment Without Free Will</b>
</p>
<p>
Let us summarize:
</p>
<p>
1.	Because the world is deterministic, there is no free will and no moral responsibility for past actions.
</p>
<p>
2.	Maintaining the myth of free will and moral responsibility is probably not possible in the long-run.  There is too much scientific evidence against it.  Furthermore, maintaining this myth results in outcomes that often do not serve the social good.
</p>
<p>
3.	Even without the belief in free will and moral responsibility we can create moral rules and justify punishments for violating those rules.  The punishments serve to educate and deter.  In addition, in some cases confinement can be justified where confinement is necessary to protect the public.
</p>
<p>
Deterrence works because the brain is capable of weighing costs and benefits to various proposed courses of action.  Both freeists and afreeists assume this.  How do we apply deterrence?  Let us look again at the freeist position, since that seems to underlie our current conceptions of the criminal law.  The freeist position is that if someone commits a crime (robs a bank) of their own free will, then she is morally responsible for her actions.  That is, she is blameworthy.  Because she is blameworthy, we feel justified in punishing her. 
</p>
<p>
The criminal law operationalizes this idea of free will and moral responsibility through a number of doctrines.  Two of these are the doctrine of mens rea and the defense of compulsion.  Mens rea is a latin term meaning guilty mind but perhaps better described as criminal intent.  In order to win a criminal case, the prosecutor must prove (among other things) mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt.  It makes a difference to the criminal law whether one acts purposefully, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.  For most criminal offenses, if someone commits a prohibited act intending the results of that act, then one has committed the act purposefully and (if the other elements of the crime are proven) is guilty of a criminal offense.  If someone shoots and kills someone with the intent to kill her, then the shooter is guilty of a criminal offense.  Likewise, if a bank robber detonates a safe, not for the purpose of killing someone (since the bank robber is only interested in the money), but knowing that the bank employee sitting near the safe will be killed, then the bank robber is guilty of murder.  Taking an action that will purposefully or knowingly kill someone, is defined as murder.  
</p>
<p>
Mental state makes a big difference in the criminal law.  Consider the following variations of someone (a driver) who kills someone else (a victim) by running her over in a car:
</p>
<p>
1.	The driver intends to kill the victim.
</p>
<p>
2.	The driver is drunk and impaired.  The driver does not intend to kill anyone.
</p>
<p>
3.	The driver is not drunk or impaired, but is operating the vehicle negligently, perhaps driving 50 mph in a 25 mph school zone.  The driver does not intend to kill anyone.
</p>
<p>
4.	The driver is old and infirm with poor eyesight and slow reaction time.  The driver does not see the victim in time and kills her.
</p>
<p>
5.	The driver is driving fast at the point of a gun.    The driver loses control and runs over and kills the victim.
</p>
<p>
6.	The driver is in fact driving reasonably for the conditions and obeying all laws.  Nevertheless, the driver suffers a stroke in the car, loses control, and kills the victim.
</p>
<p>
7.	The driver is in fact driving reasonably for the conditions and obeying all laws.  Nevertheless, the victim runs out in front of the car, is struck, and dies.
</p>
<p>
The law treats each of these differently.  The traditional freeist rationale is that the examples represent three different levels of moral culpability.  
</p>
<p>
However, in reality all of these cases were the result of deterministic causal chains in which there was no free will.  For this reason, none of the actors have moral responsibility.  Nevertheless, we can analyze these cases on the basis of deterrence and incapacitation.  In the first case, where the driver intends to kill the victim, deterrence plays a big role.  In a world in which there are consequences for committing murder, we would expect fewer murders.  We could all agree that, in this example, the driver should face serious consequences, including incarceration.
</p>
<p>
In the drunk driving case we would like to give incentives 1) not to get so drunk and 2) once drunk, not to get behind the wheel of a car and 3) once drunk and behind the wheel of a car, to drive very very carefully.  By punishing drunk driving we probably influence all three behaviors.
</p>
<p>
As for someone who is old and infirm, incapacitation might be the most rational response to the above event.  We suspend the license.  In addition, policies requiring more frequent tests for licensing might also be appropriate.  Those with abnormally slow reactions, poor eyesight, etc., would not be able to get their licenses renewed.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, negligent driving can be deterred through fines, imprisonment, and compensation to the victims.  Thus many of the doctrines that are now justified by free will and moral responsibility can be equally justified by deterrence.
</p>
<p>
In cases 5 through 7, there is no need for deterrence, therefore no need to punish.  The bottom line is that many aspects of the criminal justice system will not change.  However, some will, and should, change.  I discuss these in the next section.
</p>
<p>
<b>Criminal Justice Reform</b>
</p>
<p>
The main benefit in recognizing that the world is deterministic is that, by abandoning the notions of free will, moral responsibility, and retribution, we can get on with reforming the criminal justice system.
</p>
<p>
The criminal justice system in the United States is in bad need of reform.  Prison sentences are far too lengthy and far too common.    The International Centre for Prison Studies reports that 714 persons per 100,000 population are currently imprisoned in the United States.   U.S. prisons are barbaric, violent, dehumanizing institutions.  Inmates are regularly humiliated and brutalized.  The Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit that works for prison reform in Alabama reports that,
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
The warehousing of one in 100 Americans has all but eradicated rehabilitative programs, and the conditions of confinement in jails, prisons, and detention facilities have dramatically worsened. In 2011, conditions became so “horrendous” in California—home to some of the country’s harshest “Three Strikes, You’re Out” enhanced sentencing laws—that the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata required the state to release up to 46,000 prisoners after finding that its severely overcrowded prisons and grossly inadequate medical and mental health care is “incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.”
</p>
<p>
About 75,000 people in the United States are held in solitary confinement, spending 23 or more hours a day in small cells, allowed out only for showers, brief exercise, or medical visits, without telephone calls or visits from family members. The use of long-term isolation escalated after “tough on crime” policies led states to build super-maximum-security prisons in the 1980s and 1990s. Studies show that people held in long-term solitary confinement suffer from anxiety, paranoia, perceptual disturbances, and deep depression. Nationwide, suicides among people held in isolation, who make up 3 to 8 percent of the nation's prison population, account for about 50 percent of prison suicides.

This barbarism has many sources, but retribution is likely primary among them.  Once a person is found guilty, particularly of violent crimes, but also of nonviolent drug offenses, that person is deprived of her humanity.  The convict gets what she “deserves,” no matter how dehumanizing and brutal the treatment. 
</p>
<p>
If we understand the causal determinism of the universe, we also understand that this treatment is unjustified.  The commission of the crime was determined by factors that were in place long before the criminal was born.  How can such a person be responsible for her actions?  
</p>
<p>
Realizing that the universe is deterministic should help us empathize both with the offender and with those harmed by the offender.  It should release us from that “frothy limbic state”  referred to earlier in this chapter, the state our brains are in when we administer punishment to those who we believe deserve it.  Instead, we would apply punishment reluctantly, grudgingly and even sparingly.  Above all, we try to do it rationally, all the time realizing that there but for the grace of the universe go I.  We should be asking what is the least amount of punishment that will produce an acceptable amount of deterrence?  Can we use this opportunity to teach the offender (and others in society) moral, social, or civic values?  As a last resort, perhaps the offender is dangerous and cannot be reformed.  In that case, we may have to separate the offender from the rest of society.  But if we do, we must do so humanely.

This is not a book on the particulars of criminal justice system reform.  The takeaway points of this chapter are these: 
</p>
<p>
1.	The criminal system will not collapse once one realizes (a) that the universe unfolds deterministically and (b) that, because of this, people are not morally responsible for what they do.  Deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation continue to make sense as morally justifiable bases for punishment.
</p>
<p>
2.	The mistaken notions of free will and moral responsibility have led to the acceptance of retribution as a rationale for punishment.  This has contributed to the brutality and inhumanity of our current criminal justice system.  (This criticism applies to compatibilist defenses of free will and moral responsibility as much as to the libertarian defenses.  )
</p>
<p>
3.	By jettisoning the concepts of free will and moral responsibility, we can create a criminal justice system that makes sense.  I believe that, in such a system, punishments will be fewer and less severe than under the current system, prisons will become humane institutions, and we will put increasing resources into rehabilitation.   (Recall the studies that I reported in Chapter 7.  Those who have a greater belief in determinism are less likely to be punitive and less likely to act vindictively. )

<b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p>
As this book is going to press, the case of R. Kelly is in the news.  R. Kelly (a tremendously gifted and successful musician) was the subject of the Lifetime television series, Surviving R. Kelly.  The series chronicled a series of abusive relationships that R. Kelly had with underage girls.  How should we look at this?  In a deterministic world, what happened had to happen.  There is no blame, just victims.  It is perhaps noteworthy that R. Kelly himself was the victim of abuse as a child.  But this is irrelevant to the issue of whether R. Kelly deserves blame.  Whether or not R. Kelly was abused, his actions were the result of a causal chain. 
</p>
<p>
If R. Kelly is found to have intentionally sexually abused underage girls, then he should be punished.  That punishment will serve to deter others from engaging in similar activity in the future.  The sentence that R. Kelly receives should also include measures to improve his behavior once he is out of confinement.  That is, we should attempt to rehabilitate R. Kelly, by teaching him to follow moral and social norms.  In designing the punishment, we should make it as humane and rehabilitative as possible, consistent with our desire to deter.  Retribution (locking him up in a brutal and inhumane prison for years because that is what he “deserves”) should not be part of the equation.
