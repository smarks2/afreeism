<p>
Learning to be humble and to accept ourselves and others, removes impediments to joy.  Being active in trying to improve our own lives and those of others (without the burdens of regret, remorse, or despair), can be tremendously rewarding.  I believe that the afreeist perspective, besides being the most accurate representation of reality, can make life more joyful.  An understanding of the deterministic universe can make us feel more connected, help us live more in the moment, encourage us to take steps to change the world for the better, and perhaps make us more appreciative and thankful for our little time upon the earth.

As we ponder the universe, it is easy to become overcome by its magnitude, complexity, and beauty.  Using space telescopes such as the Hubble, scientists have found evidence of over 100 billion galaxies with hundreds of billion of stars each.  Black holes, neutron stars, quasars, and other bizarre phenomena populate the universe.  And at the other end of the scale, atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, quarks, neutrinos, bosons, and antimatter interact in strange non-Newtonian ways.  Life itself in its dizzying variety and complexity astounds.  Organisms strange and wonderful live in the most uninhabitable places, such as undersea volcanic vents and in the wind currents circling the earth.

Interdependent causal chains of immense complexity underlie all of this.  We understand a small part of these chains, typically taken in isolation.  We see only parts of an immense swirling puzzle.  The sheer complexity of it all, that the universe should produce such a grand tapestry, and that we can know only a bit of it for such a short time should leave us awestruck.  As Christopher Hitchens says,

<p>
This is more than enough mystery and marvel for any mammal to be getting along with.

Wonder is the other side of the humility coin.  Humility is the recognition of our insignificance; wonder is the appreciation of the magnitude, complexity, and beauty of the world around us. Stand at the edge of the Grand Canyon on a clear night with the Milky Way like a luminous cloud.  Ponder the beauty and complexity of the universe.  It does not get any better than that.
