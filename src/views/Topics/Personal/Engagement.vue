Engagement is our willingness and commitment to get involved, that is, to engage with the universe and the beings that inhabit it.  Resilience is our ability to take what the universe throws at us.  Here are some aspects of engagement and resilience:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	Connectedness.  Being engaged is understanding that we are all connected.  We are connected to each other and to everything animate and inanimate through the complex causal web that is the universe.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	Presence.  Being engaged involves living in the present.  It means not being fixated on the past or paralyzed by the future.  The past is useful for learning, but we are not responsible for it.  We can affect the future, but we should not be overwhelmed by it.  We live in the present moment.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
3.	Inquisitiveness.  Being engaged is being inquisitive.  There are both aesthetic and practical sides to this.  Aesthetically, the universe is so vast, so splendid in its detail and variety, so full of unexpected beauty, that it invites our curiosity.  On the practical side, what we do affects the future.  To understand how best to affect the future, we need to understand as much as we can about how the world works.  In order to engage productively with the universe, we need knowledge.  What makes our world work?  What makes our society function for the benefit of all?  What makes our fellow humans tick?
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
4.	Involvement.  What we do matters.  Afreeism invites us to get involved.  The foundation of afreeism is the understanding that the universe is causal.  Because it is causal, we have the ability to affect the future.  
</p>
<p>
Let us look at each of these aspects of engagement and resilience.
</p>

<p><b>Connectedness</b></p>

<p>
Being part of the universe means that we are connected to it.  Because of the web of causation, everything connects with, affects, and is affected by everything else.  Determinism reminds us that we are not islands.  
</p>
<p>
Buddhism, whose writings evidence a deterministic worldview, observes that the world is so connected and seamless that one cannot even tell where a person ends and the rest of the universe begins.  This, in Buddhism, is the denial of the self.  As such, it does not make sense even to talk about individuals as if they were separate entities.  In Buddhism, we are part of the web of the universe and there is no real boundary between the set of causes that we sometimes refer to as “me” and those that we sometimes refer to as “not me.”  This profound sense of connectedness is completely consistent with the deterministic universe.
</p>
<p>
Even if we do not accept the Buddhist denial of self, we can acknowledge that the boundary between the self and the rest of the universe is fuzzy.  Who we are is not determined just by what we are inside.  Rather, we swim in a sea of expectations.  The expectations of others affect how we think, how we emote, and what we consider to be appropriate behavior.  Have you ever moved to a new city to start a new life, a city where you know no one and no one knows you?  This probably happens once or twice in one’s lifetime, and often when one is young.  I have talked to people about this experience.  The overwhelming feeling most people seem to have when they do this is exhilaration, a feeling that anything is possible.  This comes from throwing off the web of expectations which box us in and define who we are.  It is also a reminder about how connected we are.
</p>
<p>
<b>Presence</b>
</p>
<p>
People often forget to live in the moment.  They are either mired in the past, about what should have or could have been, or worried about the future.  As we saw in Chapter 14, afreeism teaches us to let go of the past.  Feelings of guilt, regret, remorse, and self-blame, do not make sense.  Afreeists look to the past for only two things, good memories and good lessons.  Other than that, we should let go.
</p>
<p>
As for the future, since we can affect it, we do need to spend some time considering it.  What we do today will affect what happens tomorrow.  So we should try to make the best choices possible.  
</p>
<p>
But do we have to agonize over the future?  Agonizing about the future is often the result of projected regrets.  That is, we are afraid that in the future we will regret the choice we are making now.  We are afraid that we will be kicking ourselves.  Such fears can be paralyzing.
</p>
<p>
In a deterministic universe, it does not make sense to have regrets either now or in the future.  This will help us to make whatever decisions we need to make now, and then get back to enjoying today.  
</p>
<p>
The Stoics had this perspective.  Here is the Roman Stoic Marcus Aurelius:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Keep this in mind, that each of us lives only this present and indivisible moment. Everything else has either already been lived or is uncertain. 
</p>
<p>
The Stoics believed that most people spend too much time fixated on both the past and the future.  Rather we should make the best decisions we can and then stop worrying.  The past is over and the future will work out as it will.  Here is Marcus Aurelius again:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Do not disturb yourself by imagining your whole life at once. Don’t always be thinking about what sufferings, and how many, might possibly befall you. Ask instead, in each present circumstance: “What is there about this that is unendurable and unbearable?” You will be embarrassed to answer.  
</p>
<p>
Seneca agrees:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Memory recalls the torments of fear, and foresight anticipates them. It is only the present that makes no one wretched. 
</p>
<p>
Again, Seneca was not saying that we should ignore either the past or the future.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Both the future and the past can delight us – one in anticipation, the other in memory – but one is uncertain and may not happen, while the other cannot fail to have been. What madness it is, therefore, to lose our grip on that which is the surest thing of all!  
</p>
<p>
The surest thing of all is the present.  If we rest too much of our happiness on what has been and what will be, we will be missing out on the most important source of happiness: that which is happening now.  Seneca again:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Think about individuals; consider men in general; there is not one whose life is not focused on tomorrow. What harm is there in that, you ask? Infinite harm. They are not really living. They are about to live.  
</p>
<p>
And again:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Two things we must therefore root out: fear of distress in the future and the memory of distress in the past. The one concerns me no longer. The other concerns me not yet.  
</p>
<p>
The Buddha concurs:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Let not a person revive the past 
<br />
Or on the future build his hopes 
<br />
For the past has been left behind 
<br />
And the future has not been reached 
<br />
Instead with insight, let him see 
<br />
Each presently arisen state
<br />
 Let him know that and be sure of it 
<br />
Invincibly and unshakably 
<br />
Today the effort must be made; 
<br />
Tomorrow, death may come, who knows? 
</p>
<p>
The modern day practice of mindfulness (a practice highly influenced by Buddhism), largely adopts this perspective.
</p>
<p>
<b>Inquisitiveness</b>
</p>
<p>
Afreeism emphasizes the deterministic causal nature of the universe, the idea that the universe is governed by laws, not by gods or demons.  It eschews the supernatural and demands evidence.  The more we understand the causes that determine the universe, the better we can shape the world and ourselves in order to live and thrive.  We should be inquisitive, questioning, curious, skeptical.   We should educate ourselves.  
</p>
<p>
One does not have to be an afreeist to understand the power and potential of knowledge.  Yet many are susceptible to making exceptions.  A scientist may be rigorously scientific at work, but willingly accept the mystical transubstantiation of bread into flesh on Sundays.  Likewise, a doctor may understand why a tumor causes tremors in a patient at the hospital but in the jury box may condemn a criminal to brutal imprisonment as retribution for an act done in “free will,” an equally mythical concept.  There is no shortage of examples.  People parse horoscopes, employ spiritual mediums, and look to karma.  
</p>
<p>
Afreeism teaches us that the universe is causal.  Rather than relegate answers to priests and shamans, we need to strive for a genuine understanding of the way the world works.  This applies to basic science, but it also applies to our personal relationships and everyday life.  Rather than trying to explain the behavior of others simplistically (“she is just a bad person”), we should really try to understand what caused a person to do what she did and what molded her character.  Greater understanding of the universe and of people can only make our lives better.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Action</b>
</p>
<p>
Determinism is not fatalism.  Fatalism, as it is often defined, is the belief that a certain outcome will occur irrespective of any actions taken.  If you are destined for hell, nothing you can do can change that.  According to fatalism, you can do A or you can do B, but you will always end up at C.  That is not what determinism implies.  Doing A or doing B produces different outcomes.  What you choose is determined, but different actions bring different results.  In other words, we are all part of the causal web of the universe.  As such, what we do ripples across that causal web.  Our actions have consequences.  If I stick myself with a pin I will feel pain.  So I do not do it.  
</p>
<p>
Likewise, if I throw myself into social activism, I could make changes in society that could improve the lot of thousands of people.  True, my actions are caused, but I am also a cause.  Indeed, the Stoics (our Greek determinists) were people of action.  Seneca was a philosopher, playwright, Roman senator, and advisor to the emperor Nero.  Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of Rome from 61 CE until his death in 80 CE.   Because the universe is causal, and because we are one of the causes, we can make a difference.
