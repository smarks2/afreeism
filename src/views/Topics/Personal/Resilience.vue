<p>
Bad things happen.  Some are the result of things other people do.  Others are the result of what we ourselves have done.  And sometimes bad things just happen, things that are not the result of what we or anyone else has done.  The death of a child from cancer or from a seemingly random genetic defect are examples of this.  And sometimes we are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Afreeism teaches us to be tolerant of other people, not just of who they are, but also of what they do.  Tolerance is a form of resilience.  It helps us to understand and accept what other people do, even if it affects us adversely.  Self-acceptance is also a form of resilience.  Understanding that we are not morally responsible for what we have done or for what we have become, helps us to accept the past, learn from it, and move on.

Finally, even unfortunate events that just happen for no apparent reason are still caused, still inevitable.  Understanding that these occurrences are determined from the beginning of time may help us withstand the blow and move on.

<b>An Excercise</b>
</p>
<p>
The Stoics believed that we could better learn to accept the past, to prepare for the future, and to enjoy the present. They developed an exercise to help us accomplish this.  The modern term for this ancient practice is negative visualization.   Negative visualization is the present contemplation of future loss or failure.  There are a number of reasons to engage in this exercise.  One is to enhance the enjoyment of the things we have now, to keep us  from succumbing to hedonic adaptation.  Hedonic adaptation occurs when we get so used to the good things we have that they no longer bring us pleasure.  
</p>
<p>
Another reason to engage in negative visualization is to help us take measures to prevent some loss or failure in the first place.  Psychologist Gary Klein applied this technique to business whereby managers, before a project is accepted or launched, are encouraged to visualize the project failing and then to give a “premortem” on why it failed.  Contemplating what can go wrong, whether in business or in our personal lives, helps us to prevent a negative outcome from occurring.
</p>
<p>
The third reason to engage in negative visualization is to prepare us emotionally if the loss or failure actually occurs.  As Seneca says,
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
He robs present ills of their power who has perceived their coming beforehand. 
</p>
<p>
In his book on Stoic philosophy, Professor William B. Irvine writes about the Greek Stoic Epictetus along the same lines:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
[Epictetus] counsels us, for example, when we kiss our child, to remember that she is mortal and not something we own—that she has been given to us “for the present, not inseparably nor forever.” His advice: In the very act of kissing the child, we should silently reflect on the possibility that she will die tomorrow. [Epictetus, “Discourses,” II.xxiv.86,88]   In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius approvingly quotes this advice. [Marcus, XI.34]  
</p>
<p>
This negative visualization not only increases our enjoyment of our child today, it helps us protect her going forward and prepares us for what could happen tomorrow.  Note that in this formulation there is both action as to the future and acceptance as to the past.  Negative visualization helps us with both.
