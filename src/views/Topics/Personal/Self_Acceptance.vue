It is hard to be alive without messing up, often significantly.  The more one lives, the more opportunity one has to make mistakes.  We often have feelings of guilt, regret, and remorse for these actions or inactions.  Feelings of guilt pervade our society.  One article that appeared in the Guardian in 2017 was entitled, “Why Do We Feel So Guilty All The Time?”  Its author laments:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Filial guilt, fraternal guilt, spousal guilt, maternal guilt, peer guilt, work guilt, middle-class guilt, white guilt, liberal guilt, historical guilt, Jewish guilt: I’m guilty of them all.   
</p>
<p>
Guilt has been a major focus of psychological studies and theorizing at least since the time of Freud, who had a lot to say on the subject.  A Google search for “scholarly articles on guilt” turns up over 2.5 million hits.  Therapists routinely deal with feelings of guilt in their practices.

One of the great inventions of the Catholic Church is confession.  In the Catholic Church you can go into the confessional, confess your sins, do your penance (typically saying a handful of prayers), and then you are forgiven.  You can move on with your life.  And this includes the worst possible sins.  Of course, not all of our errors are sins.  However, for those that are sins, the sacrament of confession confers forgiveness on the sinner and can alleviate feelings of guilt, regret, and remorse.

But afreeism is even better.  In our deterministic universe, guilt, regret, and remorse are irrational.  Since the world is determined, then we made the only decisions we could have made.  True, we made choices, but those choices were based on preferences and values that were caused.  How can we blame ourselves for past actions when those actions were determined?  Someone who really understands the deterministic nature of the universe should be free of guilt, regret, remorse, and self-blame.  Even if you ended up where you are because of poor values, poor judgment, uncontrolled emotions or unhealthy desires, all of these were determined by a chain of causation dating back to long before you were born.

Pain in life is unavoidable.  We sometimes hurt and we sometimes hurt other people.  It is quite natural to feel pain and sadness when we see others, both loved ones and strangers, in pain.  But it does not help to add regret, remorse, shame or guilt to our pain and sadness.  We should learn from the past.  We should analyze the chain of causation that led to undesirable ends – doing so will help us act more wisely in the future – but we should not beat ourselves up over past choices.

<b>An Exercise</b>
</p>
<p>
People can be full of regret and remorse.  They made the wrong career choice.  They married the wrong person, and stayed in the unhappy marriage for far too many years.  They had an affair, which destroyed their marriage and ruined their relationship with their children.  They made the wrong financial decisions.  They put their money in foolish investments or they lost it gambling.  They avoided going to the doctor for too long, allowing the cancer to progress.  They put their kids into the wrong schools.  They were absent as parents.  They trusted the wrong people.  
</p>
<p>
Afreeism teaches us that it makes no sense to feel regret for these actions.  But regret is a powerful emotion and we have been socially programmed to feel it.  How do we overcome it?
</p>

One way is through visualization.  Imagine that you are a free-floating bodiless soul.  (This is just an exercise.  You do not actually have to believe in the existence of souls.)  What would happen if you were randomly placed into the body of someone you did not know?  (Suppose that the previous soul had to vacate the body for unknown reasons and that you are taking its place.)  The body that you have come to inhabit has a history, which is now your history.  What do you do?
</p>
<p>
In whatever body you have been placed, you must decide how to move forward with the new life that you have just inherited.  For a start, you make an assessment of your present situation.  Are you married or single, what is your financial situation, do you have children, what are your children’s situations, etc.  Clearly you will have challenges.  There are things from your inherited history that you will have to deal with.  Perhaps the body that you are in committed some crime or insulted someone or had a bad relationship with her mother.  True, there may be some stories from this history that make you smile and feel good.  Others might make you cringe.  Others will teach you things.  You might prefer that the person who formally occupied the body had not done some of the things she did, but you cannot feel any personal responsibility for them or any personal regret for having done them, because you were not even there.
</p>
<p>
In a sense, this is actually the situation we are in.  Sure, we did some things that we wish we had not been caused to do, but we cannot regret them because they simply had to happen.  We now have to assess our situation and deal with what we have going forward.  
</p>
<p>
This leads to the following morning exercise:  Get up, have your cup of coffee or tea and then sit quietly for a moment imagining that you have simply been put into this body and into this life this very morning.  No regrets, no guilt.  You are not responsible for what has happened.  Now assess where you are and move on.  
</p>
<p>
Not only will this exercise help rid your psyche of feelings of guilt, regret, and remorse, it might also give you an appreciation for the good fortune that you have had.  Of all the bodies that you could have inhabited, you somehow ended up with this one.  For many of us, this is far better than most of the other bodies in the world that we could have gotten stuck in.  If we have had this good fortune, then it is important to remember that this is not true for everyone.  Some people have inherited histories, character traits, family situations and health conditions far worse than ours.  They are not responsible for this.  Their lives were determined just as much as ours.  This brings us back again to that old (modified) chestnut: there but for the grace of the universe go I.  This should give us a bit of empathy.
