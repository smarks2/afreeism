<p>
What indeed is the meaning of life, particularly in a deterministic world?  Philosophers have engaged this question since the beginning of recorded history and almost certainly before that.  Indeed, the search for meaning is perhaps the single most important inquiry of philosophy.  
</p>
<p>
You will not find the answer to the meaning of life here.  If anything, the realization that the universe is deterministic makes that question more difficult.  What meaning could life possibly have if the universe unfolds deterministically, if all human actions have been determined since the beginning of time?  Nevertheless, although no universal answers are forthcoming, we may be able to clarify our thinking on this important question in some useful ways. 
</p>
<p>
What Does Meaning Mean?
</p>
<p>
Theological descriptions of meaning and purpose often derive meaning and purpose from an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good deity.  In this conception, the deity creates humans (and everything else) for the deity’s reasons and purposes.  These reasons and purposes are not necessarily known to, or even knowable by, humans.  The purpose of an individual is simply to obey (and perhaps fear or love) the deity.  By obeying the deity, the person is furthering the deity’s purpose, however inscrutable it may be.  This obedience is purpose enough for humans, although there may be the additional benefit of a reward, such as heaven, a favorable reincarnation, or perhaps good fortune here on earth.
</p>
<p>
Note that this description addresses two notions of meaningfulness:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	Why are we here?
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	What constitutes a meaningful life?
</p>
<p>
The theistic answers to these questions are typified by the Christian responses to these questions.  We are here because God created us for his purposes.  A meaningful life is one lived by the rules that God has set out for us.  God’s plan is what gives our life meaning.  As Nietzsche recognized, in reference to Christianity, meaning requires, 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
A kind of unity, some form of "monism":' and as a result of this belief man becomes obsessed by a feeling of profound relativity and dependence in the presence of an All. . . At bottom, man loses the belief in his own worth when no infinitely precious entity manifests itself through him . . . 
</p>
<p>
Other monotheistic systems, such as Judaism and Islam, have similar doctrines around meaning.
</p>
<p>
Belief systems do not have to be theistic to convey meaning.  Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, all create metaphysical systems that define meaning.  These systems typically skip the first question of why we exist.  As to the second, these belief systems provide that a meaningful life is one that is lived according to the precepts of the system.  
</p>
<p>
The above description of nontheistic systems applies broadly.  Soviet communism and Nazi nationalism both were belief systems that gave their adherents purpose, defined what the good life was, and prescribed how to find meaning in life.  Both had their canonical texts, their charismatic leaders, their gardens of Eden, and their demands for complete loyalty.  Indeed, we can even find similar characteristics in the writings of some of the advocates of capitalism, socialism and other economic and social systems.
</p>
<p>
These dogmatic viewpoints have advantages and disadvantages.  The disadvantage is that they depend on faith - that is, on an adherence to beliefs without recourse to evidence or experimentation.  One simply believes.  As a result, any belief can be justified, from the benevolent to the heinous.  The advantage of dogmatic viewpoints is that, since they do not have to justify their beliefs, they can describe fairly easily what is a meaningful life.  A meaningful life is one led in accordance with the rules of the deity (or, in the case of nontheistic religions, with the rules of the system.)  
</p>
<p>
<b>Afreeism and Meaning</b>
</p>
<p>
Afreeism is not necessarily inconsistent with a belief in a deity or a belief in a metaphysical system.  Indeed, some religious traditions embrace determinism, although many do not.  Afreeism may conflict with religious or metaphysical systems in two ways.  First, if the religious or metaphysical system embraces the belief in free will, then this is clearly incompatible with afreeism.  Second, afreeism is not faith-based.  Instead, it is based on empirical observation and logical reasoning.  This may make it difficult for the afreeist to embrace faith-based arguments even if they do not directly contradict afreeism.
</p>
<p>
Afreeism has contrasting advantages and disadvantages to religious belief.  Afreeism does not accept things on faith.  Skepticism is one of its foundational values.  The rejection of free will and desert all come from the notion that the universe is causal, an observation borne out by evidence.  In contrast, as to the question of why we are here, the afreeist response is simply, we don’t know.  Indeed, there does not appear to be any reason why we are here beyond the fortunate coming together of physical forces.
</p>
<p>
These same physical forces will lead to our destruction.  The sun will someday become a supernova and engulf the solar system.  The world will perish and so will the human race.  Even if we somehow manage to escape the solar system in time, and establish a thriving society elsewhere, those suns too will supernova or collapse.  Nothing lasts forever.  The human race is no exception.  
</p>
<p>
The realization that the universe is deterministic may further add to the skepticism as to whether life has meaning.  Even if we were not doomed to oblivion, what meaning could possibly exist in a universe where every action, every thought, every gesture, is determined by causal factors in place since the beginning of time?
</p>
<p>
Nietzsche recognized that, without the dogmatic claims of religion, we are staring into the abyss of nihilism. Nihilism, most simply defined, is the absence of meaning in life.  Nietzche exclaimed,
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Nihilism stands at the door: whence comes this uncanniest of all guests?
</p>
<p>
His answer:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
At bottom, man has lost the faith in his own value when no infinitely valuable whole works through him; i.e., he conceived such a whole in order to be able to believe in his own value.
</p>
<p>
Without some universally accepted dogma (some “infinitely valuable whole”), nihilism, the utter lack of meaning to life, is at our doorstep.  Beyond this observation, Nietzsche had no answers (or at least none that he was willing to commit to pen and paper) for the possibility that there was no meaning at all.  In Europe, where Nietzsche was writing, this “infinitely valuable whole” was Christianity.  “God is Dead,” Nietzche had previously observed.  Hence the descent into nihilism.
</p>
<p>
I should say that nihilism does have some redeeming features.  The fall of a universal Christian conception in the West of what is a good and meaningful life opened up the world for those living outside the contours of the Christian ideal.  As philosopher Sean Kelly has written:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
. . . when the structure of a worthwhile and well-lived life is no longer agreed upon and taken for granted, then a new sense of freedom may open up. Ways of living life that had earlier been marginalized or demonized may now achieve recognition or even be held up and celebrated. Social mobility ─ for African Americans, gays, women, workers, people with disabilities or others who had been held down by the traditional culture ─ may finally become a possibility. 
</p>
<p>
But there is a downside.  In the same article, Kelly remarks, 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Without any clear and agreed upon sense for what to be aiming at in a life, people may experience the paralyzing type of indecision depicted by T.S. Eliot in his famously vacillating character Prufrock; or they may feel, like the characters in a Samuel Beckett play, as though they are continuously waiting for something to become clear in their lives before they can get on with living them; or they may feel the kind of “stomach level sadness” that David Foster Wallace described, a sadness that drives them to distract themselves by any number of entertainments, addictions, competitions, or arbitrary goals, each of which leaves them feeling emptier than the last.  
</p>
<p>
Without a faith-based metaphysical system that proclaims what a meaningful life is, and facing the fact of a universe governed by determinism, the afreeist must confront the problem of nihilism.
</p>
<p>
<b>Meaning in a Deterministic World</b>
</p>
<p>
Afreeism rejects dogmatic assertions of meaning yet offers no simple answer to the challenge of nihilism.  Perhaps we will simply have to learn to live without the sort of unifying meaning that religious dogmas provide.  That said, we can take a few moments to speculate about whether, in a deterministic world, life can have any meaning and whether it is possible to live with purpose.  
</p>
<p>
First, as to the question of why we are here, afreeism counsels humility.  We just do not know.  It is likely that there is no reason at all.  And if there is a reason, we are likely never to know it.  This does not mean that we should not look for reasons.  It just means that we should not create reasons where none are apparent.  
</p>
<p>
Thus, as to the first question of meaning, why are we here, afreeism has no answer.  In that, it is like nontheistic religions, such as Buddhism.    
</p>
<p>
What about the second, perhaps more important, question: what is it to lead a meaningful life?  Of course, this question is not unique to afreeism.  Anyone who has overthrown dogma, anyone who lives her life through inquiry and skepticism, must face this question.  The fact that the universe is deterministic changes nothing in this regard.  
</p>
<p>
Since the problem of meaning is one afreeists share with atheists and agnostics, we can perhaps get some insight from how these non-believers approach this problem.  Interestingly, empirical evidence suggests that atheists do not have any more difficulty in finding meaning in life than do religious adherents.  A recent study of data involving 1200 subjects found that atheists and the religiously unaffiliated had no higher incidence of nihilism than religious adherents.  They all found meaning in roughly equal percentages.  Where they found meaning, however, differed significantly.  The religiously affiliated found their meaning in external sources, whereas for atheists and the religiously-unaffiliated, meaning was self-produced. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, atheists are not necessarily afreeists.  The determinism of afreeism may create additional challenges to the discovery or creation of meaning.  Nevertheless, the case of atheism is instructive.  And, again, we can harken back to the deterministic stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome.  As was noted earlier, these were people who led active purpose-driven lives.  
</p>
<p>
<b>The Source of Meaning</b>
</p>
<p>
So here are some thoughts on meaning and whence it comes.  Through biological and social evolution, we have developed into beings that are highly social and highly interdependent.  As such, there are activities that give us pleasure as individuals and others that give us pleasure as social animals.  Some pleasures are simple and atavistic, such as the pleasure of having sex or having a great meal.  Others are perhaps more complex, such as the pleasure of a good relationship, an intriguing conversation, or a friendly competition.  
</p>
<p>
Not all of our pleasures are good for us or good for society.  We may overeat, drink too much, or overindulge in recreational drugs.  At times, we may find pleasure in harming those we do not like or in expropriating their goods.  In order to counteract some of these anti-social pleasures, social and biological evolution favored us with empathy.  Empathy cannot eliminate all of our negative social tendencies, so institutions evolved to pick up the slack.  We have laws and other mechanisms for enforcing social norms.  And we have the ability to reason.  Through these mechanisms we have learned to curb many of our negative impulses.  The process of social evolution continues.  For example, I have suggested in this book that through reason we can overcome our natural tendency towards vindictiveness and retribution.   
</p>
<p>
All of our pleasures, the good and the bad, are at base neurological phenomena.  Our brains have developed in certain ways, through the operation of both biological and social evolution, to enjoy certain things and to dislike others.
</p>
<p>
To the afreeist, meaning is just another neurological phenomenon, formed through biological and social evolutionary processes.  The feeling that one’s life has meaning or purpose comes from a particular configuration in the brain.  That is not to diminish its significance.  Empirically, people report that having a meaningful or purpose-driven life is immensely satisfying.  
</p>
<p>
In this book I have identified a number of neurological phenomena.  These phenomena are the result of biological and social evolution.  Some of these, I have suggested, we as humans and as members of society have outgrown.  Indeed, I have suggested that some of these now hinder our development as a society and our happiness as members of that society.  These include the belief in free will, the propensity to blame, the desire to exact retribution, and the belief in worthiness.  Other phenomena function to make our lives better.  These include love, humility, tolerance, self-acceptance, and empathy.   
</p>
<p>
Meaningfulness is one of those neurological phenomena that makes our lives better and more joyful.  On the individual level, meaningfulness is tied to individual survival and thriving.  Thus, we find meaning in developing ourselves to our fullest potential.  But meaningfulness also has a social aspect, tied to the survival of society.  It benefits society and its members when we develop strong social bonds with each other and also when we think and act outside of ourselves for the benefit of society.  Put another way, we have evolved to care about and internalize the larger concerns of society.  We have evolved to find meaning in actions that benefit others.  We have evolved to be empathetic. 
</p>
<p>
This does not answer the question for any particular person as to what sorts of things will bring meaning to that person’s life.  It does suggest some possible directions, however.  Looking to both the personal and social aspects of meaning, we can identify some possible avenues of exploration.  Here are some possible aspects of a meaningful life:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
1.	Personal development:  Advancing ourselves to our fullest potential.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
2.	Social engagement:  Interacting with family, friends, and society.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
3.	Other-Directed Purpose:  Finding or creating a purpose outside of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Again, these general categories do not answer the question for any given person as to what types of activities will give her life meaning.  Particularly as to other-directed purposes, afreeism offers very little guidance as to what one’s purpose should be.  Perhaps one’s other-directed purpose is simply providing for one’s family.  Perhaps it is writing the great American novel.  Perhaps it is working in the healing arts.  Perhaps it helping people with their plumbing.  Sometimes the answer to the question of what should be my other-directed purpose is simply this:  just pick something.  
</p>
<p>
In all, I believe that these three aspects of meaning encompass the things that get us out of bed in the morning.  These are what makes life worth living.  Naturally, these observations are not unique to afreeism.    
</p>
<p>
One final observation.  An other-directed purpose can include working directly towards a better society, towards better social policies.  This could include working within an NGO, advocating in the workplace, or even working on a political campaign.  Afreeism cannot define with great specificity what a good society is, but as I have indicated previously, it does have some suggestions.  The Equality Principle introduced in Chapter 6 flows directly from the afreeist observation that nothing is ever deserved.  Afreeist ideas support a more humane criminal justice system, a more just economic system, and a more humane and fair immigration system.  These ideas and others can be cobbled together to suggest a vision of a good society, perhaps even an inspiring vision.  Working towards these can contribute to a meaningful life.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the choices we make in this regard (and all others) have all been determined.  If we are fortunate, our decision-making algorithm will incorporate the notions of a meaningful life.  We will seek self-fulfillment, deep personal relationships, and other-directed purpose.   An afreeist can embrace these aspects of meaning without contradiction.
