            <p>
              The world often lacks humility.  We much too often run into people who 
              have inflated views of themselves and their accomplishments.  How 
              refreshing it is, then, to meet people who understand that their worlds 
              are just a tiny part of the universe and who realize that their 
              accomplishments had many contributors.  From the afreeist perspective, 
              there are four aspects of humility:
            </p>
            <p>
              1.	Humans are not exempt from the laws of nature.  We may be special, 
              but we are not that special.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.	Our lives are just a speck in time compared to the sweep of time and 
              the immense web of causation.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.	The web of causation is so complex and awesome and that we really know so 
              little about what there is to know.
            </p>
            <p>
              4	Our accomplishments and our failures are not ours, but rather were determined 
              to occur long before we existed.
            </p>
            <p>
              These realizations put our lives in perspective.  They help us to avoid taking 
              ourselves so seriously.  They encourage us to listen and learn, to be more willing 
              to say “I don’t know,” and to be humble about our so-called accomplishments.  
              Let us look at each of these.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>The Laws of the Universe Apply to Us</b>
            </p>
            <p>            
              Determinism assumes that the laws of nature, the laws that govern the 
              rest of the universe, also apply to us.  This may seem evident to many, 
              but proponents of free will, most notably philosophical libertarians, 
              argue that humans have a special faculty that allows them to be exempt 
              from the laws of physics and causation.  Yet there is strong evidence 
              (as well as commonsense) that humans are just like other physical phenomena.  
              Indeed, no event has ever been observed that has not been the result of 
              causes or (in the subatomic realm) randomness.  True, there are some 
              very special things about humans, in our ability to make forward-looking 
              decisions based on reason, in our ability to communicate through language 
              and metaphor, in our ability to adapt to our environment and engineer our 
              environment to adapt to us.  (Some of these we share with other animals.)  
              But we are not so special that the laws of physics do not apply to us.  
              We are not separate from the universe, but part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Sweep of Time and Space</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Afreeism recognizes that the present is the result of causes 
              (and perhaps some quantum events) that stretch back to at least 
              the big bang, almost 14 billion years ago.    The present is 
              just a speck in time.  The Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome, 
              who were determinists, understood this.  Seneca wrote:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              Imagine the vast abyss of time, and think of the entire universe; 
              then compare what we call a human lifetime to that immensity. 
              You will see how tiny a thing it is that we wish for and seek to prolong.  
            </p>
            <p>
              And also:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              Present time is very short – so short, indeed, that for some it seems not to exist. 
              It is always in motion, it flows and hurries on; it ceases to be before it arrives. 
            </p>
            <p>             
              Marcus Aurelius concurred:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              Short-lived are both the praiser and the praised, 
              the rememberer and the remembered. And all this in just one corner of this 
              continent – and yet even here we are not in accord with each other, nor with 
              ourselves; and the whole of the earth, too, is a speck.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Not only is the present just a speck of time in the vast evolution of the universe, 
              our corner of the universe is unimaginably small compared to vastness of space.  
              The Stoics believed that by understanding how small we are compared to the 
              immensity of time and space, we could free ourselves from concern with what is 
              happening to us.  Whatever our concerns, they are small and fleeting compared to the universe.
              Marcus Aurelius again:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
You can get rid of a great number of your annoyances because they lie entirely in your own head. You will clear ample space for yourself by comprehending the scale of the universe in your mind, by observing the infinity of time, and by studying carefully the rapid change of each part of each thing – how short the time is from birth to dissolution, the time before it an abyss, the time afterwards also endless.  
</p>
<p>
And again,
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Think often about how quickly everything that exists, and that is coming into being, is carried away and disappears. For substance is like a river that constantly flows on: the action is constantly changing, and the causes of it operate in endless variations; almost nothing is fixed. And next to us is the boundless abyss of what has passed by and what is about to be, into which all things are lost. How then is he not a fool, who gets worked up and carried away over these things, complaining as if they were enduring and troublesome?  
</p>
<p>
I should say that the Stoics did not say that we should not enjoy the moment.  Quite the contrary.  Nor did they believe in inaction.  They just believed that we take ourselves too seriously and that we should lighten up a bit.  The Buddha concurs:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Most people never realize that all of us here shall one day perish. But those who do realize that truth settle their quarrels peacefully. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The Willingness to Say “I Don’t Know”</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” 
</p>

The universe is deterministic.  Events unfold because of a chain of causes.  This does not mean that the causal chain is simple.  Indeed, its complexity boggles the mind.  We know so little about how the universe unfolds, but science continues apace and we make progress every day.  We have put a person on the moon, we have eradicated smallpox, we have created cellphones and supercomputers.  Still, much eludes us.  People still die of cancer.  And many big questions also elude us.  How did we get here?  How did life begin?  Does it have any purpose at all?  What does it mean to live the good life?  
</p>
<p>
The most appropriate answer to most of these questions is, for the present,  “We don’t know.”  Yet this seems to be a difficult admission for many, if not most.  There are those who purport to have the answer to these questions of existence, purpose, and meaning.  The earth was created in six days.  Our purpose is to serve a god.  Suffering is a test of faith.  If we do the right things, we can attain heaven or nirvana.  If we fail, then hell awaits us, or perhaps reincarnation to try again.  So many answers, so little evidence!
</p>
<p>
Causal determinism eschews the metaphysical and the supernatural.  Events are caused and, through scientific inquiry, perhaps we will learn a little about how the universe functions and where it and we are heading.  Maybe we can get a bit better at making predictions.  More than anything, however, the deterministic universe tells us how much we do not know.  The causal web is complex and often obscure.
</p>
<p>
This applies especially to the big issues of existence, meaning, and purpose.  These are important issues and have been the subject of study and speculation throughout the centuries.  It is only natural to want to know the answers.  We need to continue to experiment, to collect data, and to ponder.  We also have to accept that we may never have the answers.”  Causal determinism holds out hope that each day we might understand something better than we do the day before, but the enormous complexity of causal chains means that we will always have uncertainty.  The humility of a simple “We don’t know” is vastly better than making up “truths” that have no evidence to support them.  
</p>
<p>
<b>The Illusion of Accomplishment</b>
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 6, in reference to afreeist social policy, I spoke of the myth of deservedness and the illusion of accomplishment.  These concepts apply, perhaps with even more force, to our personal lives.  In a deterministic world, our accomplishments are not really ours but rather the result of a chain of causation.  True, we may be smart and creative, and we may have worked hard, but our propensity for hard work, our intelligence, and our creativity were all determined long before we were born.  
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand the full implication of this.  In a causal universe, hard work is an input (a cause) which, when combined with other inputs, can lead to success in the future.  
</p>
<p>
However, when we look at our accomplishments, we should realize that they simply had to happen.  They were determined long before we were born.  We just happened to be the instrument.  In reality, we were just along for the ride.  This realization should give us an abiding sense of humility.  The Buddha expressed this same sentiment:
</p>
<p>
Even as a solid rock is unshaken by the wind, so are the wise unshaken by praise or blame. 
</p>
<p>
Determinism tells us that accomplishment is an illusion.  We should enjoy it but not become so full of ourselves.  Our failures are similar.  They too are the product of a chain of causation.  
</p>
<p>
Understanding the deterministic nature of the universe can also mitigate what psychologists call “serf-serving bias.”   Self-serving bias is the propensity to interpret events in a way that increases our self-esteem.  One manifestation of this is to take credit for whatever goes right but to blame someone else for whatever goes wrong.  In the deterministic world, however, assigning blame and taking credit just do not make sense.
</p>
<p>
Again, even though we cannot take credit for what unfolds, this does not mean that we should not enjoy the ride.  In fact, we should enjoy it all the more.  It is like stumbling on a great restaurant.  We were just fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time.  The serendipity of it does not diminish our enjoyment.  Perhaps it even increases it.
