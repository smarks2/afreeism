  <p>
We tend to judge other people.  Sometimes we judge people based on their actions; other times we judge people based on their intentions.  We often judge people on circumstances that we know to be wholly outside of their control.  For example, we might judge people because of their race, their gender, or their sexual orientation.
</p>
<p>
Afreeism emphasizes that who people are, how they act, and what intentions they have are all determined.  All of us know (or should know) that this is true for things like skin color, sex, and sexual orientation.  But the same is also true of actions.  Because the universe is deterministic, all actions were determined long before any of the actors were alive.  
</p>
<p>
As a result, we should dispense with blame, anger, and condemnation.  Without free will, people are not morally responsible for how they acted or for their intentions when they acted.  Moral responsibility of this sort does not exist in a deterministic universe.   
</p>
<p>
This does not mean that people should not be punished.  It does not suggest that there should be no consequences for actions.  Deterrence, for example, makes perfect sense in the deterministic in which we live, if it is intelligently and compassionately applied.  But there is no room for blame, retribution, ridicule, condemnation, righteous anger or shaming.   
</p>
<p>
But we can go further than this.  Afreeism reminds us that everything is contextual.  Everything is causal.  Afreeism encourages us to look for reasons.  Rather than blaming, we should ask, why did that person act that way?  Why did she feel that way?  Why did she want to do what she did?  The causal universe prompts us to look for causes.  Trying to figure out the causes can lead to greater understanding, which in turn can help us react better to the situation.  It can also engender greater empathy.  Goethe once wrote:
</p>
<p>
With only the slightest shift in the balance of my character I believe there is no crime I could not commit. 
</p>
<p>
In other words: there but for the grace of the universe go I.  All of us are driven to what we do by causal forces unleashed eons ago.
</p>
<p>
Life can be more joyful if we can shed some of the anger that we have about other people, about the way they act, about their intentions, about the way that they have treated us.  A Buddhist sage once analogized an angry deed with grabbing hot coals to throw at someone.  It is the thrower who gets burned.  Life just feels better when we treat our fellow humans as companions in lifeâ€™s journey, rather than as adversaries or miscreants.  It feels good to stop judging.

<b>Love, Actually</b>
</p>
<p>
Even romantic love makes sense in a deterministic universe.  Indeed, a rich emotional life can contribute to our happiness.  Most humans have developed a sense of empathy.  Empathy, like other emotions is a neurological phenomenon.  It serves both to make us happy and to make others in our society happy.  In general, we all benefit when the members of society act with empathy, kindness, and love.  Understanding that the universe is deterministic does not change this.  Indeed, as indicated above, understanding that the universe is deterministic removes many of the impediments to these positive emotions.  We can love without debating whether someone deserves love.  We can be kind without pondering whether someone deserves kindness.
</p>
<p>
In short, afreeism teaches tolerance for other people, for who they are and for how they act.  It also teaches us to look for reasons for why people act as they do.  Both these aspects of tolerance can only make our society work better and make us happier.
