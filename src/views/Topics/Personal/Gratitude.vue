Gratitude is being thankful.  Does this survive determinism?  If someone does something for us, is it not because it has been determined?   Why should we be thankful?  And of the appreciation we may feel simply for being alive?  I think of the haunting song of Mercedes Sosa:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto <br />
Me dio dos luceros que cuando los abro <br />
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco <br />
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado <br />
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo
</p>
<p>
To be grateful is to be appreciative.  We can be grateful for a beautiful sunset or a warm summer’s day.  We can be grateful for something someone has done for us.  Of course, the sunset or the warm summer’s day are events that are caused by the forces unleashed a long time ago.  But so are acts of kindness.  Gratitude does not require that someone give us something of their own free will.  Gratitude makes sense in a deterministic world.

Feeling gratitude is one thing, but does it makes sense to express it to someone who has done something for us?  Take, for example, a fine meal prepared for you by a friend.  Are you appreciative?  Did the meal bring you pleasure?  If so, why not express it?  First, it will please your host.  Giving pleasure is a good thing.  Second, to the extent that your host is pleased by your expression of gratitude, it encourages future generous behavior.  Third, it conveys information to your host.  Knowing that the meal was pleasing should help your host understand what sorts of things are pleasing to others.  Finally, it probably makes us feel good as well.  Expressing gratitude makes sense in a deterministic world.
